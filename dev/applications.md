## Sets and iteration

- train/val(dev)/test vs kfold/bootstrap with test vs nested cv

- choosing sample sizes for train, val, test

- Random vs non-random splits into train/val/test.  what needs to be true?  what is less important?

- overfit val?  Use test more than once?  Do vs. don't and risks

- Review 12 Takeaways

## Error analysis

- why
- start with baseline/basic system first- why?
- eyeball and black box dev sets
- size of eyeball sample?
- risk of using all dev as eyeball sample
- error analysus for regression?
- review 19 takeaways

## bias/variance

- identify by differences in train/val error
  - 1/11
	- 15/16
	- 15/30
	- 1/2
