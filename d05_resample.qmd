# IAML Unit 5: Discussion

## Announcements

- Starting Unit 6 (Regularization/Penalized models) at end of class today; All set!
- Unit 7 is Mid-term Exam unit
  - No readings, lecture or quiz
  - Application assignment as exam (due at normal application assignment day/time; Weds, March 6th at 8pm)
  - Conceptual exam during discussion meeting (Thursday March 7th at 11 am) 
- EDA with new datasets (and the last application assignment)

Feedback

- Move application assignments - thus?  fri morning?
- some of the videos or portions don't have subtitles? (all of them?)
- Transcripts? Timestamps?
- Mic (lab, discussion?)
- more questions
- vocab dictionary 
- End with conclusions?
- Full solution of a problem posted at end of unit?

- less review of previous application assignment
- more interactive - coding problems?  Forward or backward or both?

## Bias and Variance

- General definitions - need to think about repeated estimation of something ($\hat{f}$, $\hat{DGP}$; $\hat{accuracy}$, $\hat{rmse}$)
- Examples for our models ($\hat{f}$, $\hat{DGP}$)
- Examples for our performance estimates ($\hat{accuracy}$, $\hat{rmse}$)

## Describe process to use resampling to get a performance estimate to evaluate of a single model configuration

- Which method? 
- Use held-in/held-out terminology in addition to train/test    
- Discuss the bias and variance of the performance estimate of this configuration.  Consider implications of:
  - The method
  - size of the held-in data
  - size of held out data

-----

## Describe process to use resampling to get performance estimates to select a best model configuration among many (explanatory setting?)

- When done (what are you selecting among)?
- Which method? 
- Use held-in/held-out terminology in addition to train/val
- Discuss the bias and variance of the performance estimate of this configuration
- Discuss the bias and variance of the performance estimate used to select the best configuration.  Consider implications of:
  - The method
  - size of the held-in data
  - size of held out data
- What are the implications if you use that same performance estimate to evaluate that best model configuration (i.e., estimate its performance in new data)?

-----

## Describe process to use resampling (other than nested) to get performance estimates to both select best configuration and evaluate it in new data

- Which method?
- Describe how to do it using held-in/held-out terminology in addition to train/val/test
- Discuss the bias and variance of the performance estimate used to select the best configuration.  Consider implications of:
  - The method
  - size of the held-in data
  - size of held out data
- Discuss the bias and variance of the performance estimate used to evaluate that best configuration.  Consider implications of:
  - The method
  - size of the held-in data
  - size of held out data

-----

## Describe process to use Nested CV to get performance estimates to both select best configuration and evaluate it in new data

- When used?
- Describe how to do it using held-in/held-out terminology in addition to train/val/test
- Discuss the bias and variance of the performance estimate used to select the best configuration.  Consider implications of:
  - The method
  - size of the held-in data
  - size of held out data
- Discuss the bias and variance of the performance estimate used to evaluate that best configuration.  Consider implications of:
  - The method
  - size of the held-in data
  - size of held out data

-----

## Methods to EITHER select best model configuration (among many) OR evaluate a single best model configuration

What are pros, cons, and when to use?

  - Single validation (or test) set
  - LOOCV
  - K-fold
  - Repeated k-fold
  - Bootstrap

  - ALSO: grouped k-fold

-----

## Methods to BOTH select best model configuration and evaluate that best configuration

- What is optimization bias (its just a form of bias but given a fancy name due to its source)?
- Combine above method with held out test set
- Nested CV (see [tutorial](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/work/nested-resampling/))

-----

## Discuss data leakage with resampling

- Why is data leakage a problem?
- How does noise factor into the problem?
- Why does resampling substantially reduce data leakage?
- How to use eyeball sample with single held out test set
