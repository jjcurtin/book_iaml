In other words, why cant we just fit and evaluate all of the models in our one training set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nThese models will all overfit the dataset within which they are fit to some degree.   \nIn other words, they will predict both systematic variance (the DGP) and some noise in \nthe training set.  However, they will differ in how much they overfit the training set.   \nAs the models get more flexible they will have the potential to overfit to a greater degree.\nModels with a larger number of features (e.g., more predictors, features based on interactions\nas well as raw predictors) will overfit to a greater degree.  All other things equal, the\nnon-parametric KNN will also be more flexible than the general linear model so it may \noverfit to a greater degree as well if the true DGP is linear on the features.  \nTherefore, just because a model fits the training set well does not mean it will work \nwell in new data because the noise will be different in every new dataset.  \nThis overfitting will be removed from our performance estimate if we calculate it \nwith new data (the validation set).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the available raw predictors in the training set\n\ndata_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ndata_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n10\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nfactor\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\n\noverall_qual\n0\n1\n10\n5: 424, 6: 350, 7: 304, 8: 176\n\n\ngarage_qual\n0\n1\n5\nta: 1312, no_: 81, fa: 57, gd: 13\n\n\nms_zoning\n0\n1\n7\nres: 1157, res: 217, flo: 66, com: 13\n\n\nlot_config\n0\n1\n5\nins: 1095, cor: 248, cul: 81, fr2: 39\n\n\nbldg_type\n0\n1\n5\none: 1216, tow: 108, dup: 63, tow: 46\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n1\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember from our modeling EDA that we have some issues to address as part of our feature engineering:\n\nMissing values\nPossible transformation of sale_price\nPossible transformation of other numeric predictors\nWe will need to use some feature engineering techniques to handle categorical variables\nWe may need to consider interactions among features\n\nAll of this will be accomplished with a recipe\nBut first, let’s discuss/review our first statistical algorithm"

    "text": "3.2 The Simple (General) Linear Model (LM)\nWe will start with only a quick review of the use of the simple (one feature) linear model (LM) as a machine learning model because you should be very familiar with this statistical model at this point\n\n\\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\epsilon\\)\n\nApplied to our regression problem, we might fit a model such as:\n\n\\(sale\\_price = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*gr\\_liv\\_area + \\epsilon\\)\n\nThe (general) linear model is a parametric model.

You can see how the unique effect of `gr_liv_area` \nis smaller than its overall effect from the simple regression.   This also means \nthat the overall predictive strength of the model will not be a sum of the effects \nof each predictor considered in isolation - it will likely be less.  Also, if the \ncorrelations are high, problems with multicollinearity will emerge.  This will yield \nlarge standard errors which means that the models will start to have more variance when \nfit in different training datasets!  We will soon learn about other regularized \nversions of the GLM that do not have these issues with correlated predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow well does this more complex model perform in validation? Let’s compare the previous and current visualizations of \\(sale\\_price\\) vs. \\(\\hat{sale\\_price}\\)\n\nLooks like the errors are smaller (closer to the diagonal line that would represent prefect prediction)\nClear signs of non-linearity are now present as well.

    "text": "3.4 Extension to Categorical Predictors\nMany important predictors in our models may be categorical (nominal and some ordinal predictors)\n\nSome statistical algorithms (e.g., random forest) can accept even nominal predictors as features without any further feature engineering\nBut many cannot. Linear models cannot.\nThe type of feature engineering may differ for nominal vs. ordinal categorical predictors\nFor nominal categorical predictors:\n\nWe need to learn a common approach to transform them to numeric features - dummy coding. We will learn the concept in general AND how to accomplish within a feature engineering recipe.\n\nFor ordinal predictors:\n\nWe can treat them like numeric predictors\nWe can treat them like nominal categorical predictors\n\nSee article on Categorical Predictors on the tidymodels website for more details\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Dummy Coding\nFor many algorithms, we will need to use feature engineering to convert a categorical predictor to numeric features. One common technique is to use dummy coding. When dummy coding a predictor, we transform the original categorical predictor with m levels into m-1 dummy coded features.\nTo better understand how and why we do this, lets consider a version of ms_zoning in the Ames dataset.\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; \n  table()\n\n\n    agri   commer    float    indus res_high  res_low  res_med \n       2       13       66        1        9     1157      217 \n\n\nWe will recode ms_zoning to have only 3 levels to make our example simple (though dummy codes can be used for predictors with any number of levels)\n\ndata_dummy &lt;- data_trn |&gt; \n1  select(sale_price, ms_zoning)  |&gt;\n2  mutate(ms_zoning3 = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\",\n                                                   \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n3                                 \"floating\" = \"float\")) |&gt;\n4  select(-ms_zoning)\n\n\n1\n\nMake a df (dataframe) with only sale_price and ms_zoning\n\n2\n\nfct_collapse() from the forcats package is our preferred way to collapse levels of a factor. See fct_recode() for more generic recoding of levels.\n\n3\n\nWe could have left this line out and float would have stayed as a level named float\n\n4\n\nRemove original ms_zoning predictor\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the new predictor\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  pull(ms_zoning3) |&gt; \n  table() \n\n\n commercial    floating residential \n         16          66        1383 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why can’t we simply recode each level with a different consecutive value (e.g., commercial = 1, floating =2 , residential = 3)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nThere is no meaningful way to order the numbers that we assign to the levels of \nthis unordered categorical predictor.  The shape and strength of the relationship\nbetween it and sale_price will completely change based on arbitrary ordering of \nthe levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine fitting a straight line to predict sale_price from ms_zoning3 using these three different ways to arbitrarily assign numbers to levels.\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 3,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 2)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nDummy coding resolves this issue.\n\nWhen using dummy codes, we transform (i.e., feature engineer) our original m-level categorical predictor to m-1 dummy features.\nEach of these m-1 features represents a contrast between a specific level of the categorical variable and a reference level\nThe full set of m-1 features represents the overall effect of the categorical predictor variable.\nWe assign values of 0 or 1 to each observation on each feature in a meaningful pattern (see below)\n\n\nFor example, with our three-level predictor: ms_zoning3\n\nWe need 2 dummmy features (d1, d2) to represent this 3-level categorical predictor\nDummy feature 1 is coded 1 for residential and 0 for all other levels\nDummy feature 2 is coded 1 for floating and 0 for all other levels\n\nHere is this coding scheme displayed in a table\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  ms_zoning3     d1    d2\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 commercial      0     0\n2 residential     1     0\n3 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nWith this coding:\n\nCommercial properties are coded 0 for both d1 and d2.\n\nThis means that commercial properties will become the reference level against which both residential and floating village are compared.\nBecause we are focused on prediction, the choice of reference level is mostly arbitrary. For explanatory goals, you might consider which level is best suited to be the reference.\nThere is much deeper coverage of dummy and other contrast coding in 610/710\n\n\nWe can add these two features manually to the data frame and view a handful of observations to make this coding scheme more concrete\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  sale_price ms_zoning3     d1    d2\n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     105000 residential     1     0\n2     126000 residential     1     0\n3      13100 commercial      0     0\n4     115000 residential     1     0\n5     149500 floating        0     1\n6      40000 commercial      0     0\n7     120000 residential     1     0\n8     151000 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nIf we now fit a model where we predict sale_price from these two dummy coded features, each feature would represent the contrast of the mean sale_price for the level coded 1 vs. the mean sale_price for the level that is coded 0 for all features (i.e., commercial)\n\nd1 is the contrast of mean sale_price for residential vs. commercial\nd2 is the contrast of mean sale_price for floating vs. commercial\nThe combined effect of these two features represents the overall effect of ms_zoning3 on sale_price\n\n\nLets do this quickly in base R using lm() as you have done previously in 610.\n\nm &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ d1 + d2, data = data_dummy) \n\nm |&gt; summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ d1 + d2, data = data_dummy)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-166952  -50241  -20241   31254  565259 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This would also prevent a linear model from fitting (‘dummy variable trap’).\nHowever, some statistical algorithms do not have problems with perfect multicollinearity (e.g., LASSO, ridge regression).\n\nFor these algorithms, you will sometimes see modified version of dummy coding called one-hot coding.\n\nThis approach uses one additional dummy coded feature for the final category.\n\nWe won’t spend time on this but you should be familiar with the term b/c it is often confused with dummy coding.\n\n\n\nCoding Sidebar\nWhen creating dummy coded features from factors that have levels with infrequent observations, you may occasionally end up with novel levels in your validation or test sets that were not present in your training set.\n\nThis will cause you issues.\n\nThese issues are mostly resolved if you make sure to explicitly list all possible levels for a factor when classing that factor in the training data, even if the level doesn’t exist in the training data.\n\nWe provide more detail on this issue in an appendix.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Nominal Predictors\nNow that we understand how to use dummy coding to feature engineer nominal predictors, let’s consider some potentially important ones that are available to us.\nWe can discuss if any look promising.\n\nLets return first to ms_zoning\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"ms_zoning\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might:\n\nRepresent it with 6 dummy features (because there are 7 raw levels) but many of the categories are very low n - won’t account for much variance?\nCombine all the commercial categories (agri, commer, indus), which would take care of most of the low n groups. They also all tend to have the lower prices.\nCombine all the residential to get a better feature to variance accounted ratio. They all tend to have similar prices on average and res_high is also pretty low n. \n\nData dictionary entry: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.\n\nagri: Agriculture\ncommer: Commercial\nfloat: Floating Village Residential\nindus: Industrial\nres_high: Residential High Density\nres_med: Residential Medium Density\nres_low: Residential Low Density\n\n\nlot_config\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"lot_config\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nWe see that:\n\nMost are inside lots, some of the lot categories are low n\nMedian sale_price is not very different between configurations\nNot very promising but could help some (particularly given the large sample size)\n\nData dictionary entry: Lot configuration\n\ninside: Inside lot\ncorner: Corner lot\nculdsac: Cul-de-sac\nfr2: Frontage on 2 sides of property\nfr3: Frontage on 3 sides of property\n\n\nbldg_type\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"bldg_type\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nWe see that:\n\nMost of the houses are in one category - one_fam\nThere is not much difference in median sale_price among categories\nNot very promising\n\nData dictionary entry: Type of dwelling\n\none_fam: Single-family Detached\n\ntwo_fam: Two-family Conversion; originally built as one-family dwelling\nduplex: Duplex\ntown_end: Townhouse End Unit\ntown_inside: Townhouse Inside Unit\n\n\nLet’s do some feature engineering with ms_zoning. We can now do this formally in a recipe so that it can be used in our modeling workflow.\n\nFirst, if you noticed earlier, there are some levels for ms_zoning that are pretty infrequent. Lets make sure both data_trn and data_val have all levels set for this factor.\n\n\ndata_trn |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"agri\"     \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\ndata_val |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\n\n\nAs expected, we are missing a level (agri) in data_val. Lets fix that here\n\n\ndata_val &lt;- data_val |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning = factor(ms_zoning, \n                            levels = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"float\", \"indus\", \n                                       \"res_high\", \"res_low\", \"res_med\")))\n\n[Note: Ideally, you would go back to cleaning EDA and add this level to the full dataset and then re-split into training, validation and test. This is a sloppy shortcut!]\n\nWith that fixed, let’s proceed:\n\nWe will collapse categories down to three levels (commercial, residential, floating village) as before but now using step_mutate() combined with fct_collapse() to do this inside of our recipe.\n\nWe will convert to dummy features using step_dummy(). The first level of the factor will be set to the reference level when we call step_dummy().\nstep_dummy() is a poor choice for function name. It actually uses whatever contrast coding we have set up in R. However, the default is are dummy coded contrasts (R calls this treatment contrasts). See ?contrasts and options(\"contrasts\") for more info.\n\n\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(sale_price ~ gr_liv_area + lot_area + year_built + garage_cars + ms_zoning, \n         data = data_trn) |&gt; \n  step_impute_median(garage_cars) |&gt; \n  step_mutate(ms_zoning = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\", \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n                                 \"floating\" = \"float\")) |&gt;\n  step_dummy(ms_zoning)\n\n\nCoding Sidebar\nYou should also read more about some other step_() functions that you might use for categorical predictors: - step_other() to combine all low frequency categories into a single “other” category. - step_unknown() to assign missing values their own category - You can use selector functions. For example, you could make dummy variables out of all of your factors in one step using step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()).\nSee the Step Functions - Dummy Variables and Encoding section on the tidymodels website for additional useful functions.\nWe have also described these in the section on factor steps in Appendix 1\n\nLet’s see if the addition of ms_zoning helped\n\nNotice the addition of the dummy coded features to the feature matrix\nNotice the removal of the factor ms_zoning\n\n\nrec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt; \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_trn)\n\nfeat_val &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_val)\n\n\n\nskim\n\n\nfeat_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n7\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n0\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\nms_zoning_floating\n0\n1\n0.05\n0.21\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n4.38\n17.22\n\n\nms_zoning_residential\n0\n1\n0.94\n0.23\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n-3.86\n12.90\n\n\n\n\nfeat_val |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_val\n\n\nNumber of rows\n490\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n7\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1493.00\n483.78\n480\n1143.5\n1436.0\n1729.50\n3608\n0.92\n1.16\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10462.08\n10422.55\n1680\n7500.0\n9563.5\n11780.75\n215245\n15.64\n301.66\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.08\n30.96\n1875\n1954.0\n1975.0\n2000.00\n2010\n-0.66\n-0.41\n\n\ngarage_cars\n0\n1\n1.74\n0.76\n0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.00\n4\n-0.24\n0.22\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n178512.82\n75493.59\n35311\n129125.0\n160000.0\n213000.00\n556581\n1.42\n2.97\n\n\nms_zoning_floating\n0\n1\n0.05\n0.22\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.00\n1\n4.07\n14.58\n\n\nms_zoning_residential\n0\n1\n0.93\n0.25\n0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.00\n1\n-3.51\n10.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets fit a model with these features\n\n\nfit_lm_6 &lt;- \n  linear_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"lm\") |&gt; \n  fit(sale_price ~ ., data = feat_trn)\n\n\n\nplot it\n\n\nplot_truth(truth = feat_val$sale_price, \n           estimate = predict(fit_lm_6, feat_val)$.pred)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd evaluate it\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  model                              rmse_val\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 simple linear model                  51375.\n2 4 feature linear model               39903.\n3 4 feature linear model with YJ       41660.\n4 6 feature linear model w/ms_zoning   39846.\n\n\n\nRemoving Yeo Johnson transformation but adding dummy coded ms_zoning may have helped a little\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Will the addition of new predictors/features to a model always reduce RMSE in train? in validation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nAs you know, the estimation procedure in linear models is OLS.  Parameter estimates\nare derived to minimize the SSE in the data set in which they are derived.  For this\nreason, adding a predictor will never increase RMSE in the training set and it will\nusually lower it even when it is not part of the DGP.   However, this is not true in\nvalidation.  A predictor will only meaningfully lower RMSE in validation if it is\npart of the DGP.  Also, a bad predictor could even increase RMSE in validation due to\noverfitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Ordinal Predictors\nWe have two paths to pursue for ordinal predictors\n\nWe can treat them like nominal predictors (e.g., dummy code)\nWe can treat them like numeric predictors (either raw or with an added transformation if needed)\n\n\nLet’s consider overall_qual\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"overall_qual\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nObservations:\n\nLow frequency for low and to some degree high quality response options.

In other words, what are the advantages/disadvantages of using KNN?”\n\nAlways comes down to bias vs. variance\nFlexibility and N are key moderators of these two key factors.\n\nk? - impact on bias, variance?\n\nKNN for explanation?\n\nVisualizations (think of interaction plot above) make clear the effect\nWill learn more (better visualizations, variable importance, model comparisons) in later unit\n\n\n\n\n\n3.10.6 Normalizing transformations - Yeo Johnson\n\nwhen needed for lm?\nwhen needed for knn?\n\n\n\n\n3.10.7 Dummy coding\n\nWhy do we do it?\nDescribe the values assigned to the dummy coded features\nWhy these values?

When to use or not use one-hot coding?\n\n\n\n\n3.10.8 Exploration\n\n“I feel that I can come up with models that decrease the RMSE, but I don’t have good priors on whether adding any particular variable or observation will result in an improved model. I still feel a little weird just adding and dropping variables into a KNN and seeing what gets the validation RMSE the lowest (even though because we’re using validation techniques it’s a fine technique)”\n\nExploration is learning. This is research. If you knew the answer you wouldn’t be doing the study\nDomain knowledge is still VERY important\nSome algorithms (LASSO, glmnet) will help with feature selection\nstaying organized\n\nScript structure\nGood documentation - QMD as analysis notebook\n\nSome overfitting to validation will occur? Consequence? Solutions?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.10.9 “Curse of dimensionality” - Bias vs. variance\n\nMissing features produce biased models.\nUnnecessary features or even many features relative to N produce variance\nDoes your available N in your algorithm support the features you need to have low bias.\n\nMostly an empirical question - can’t really tell otherwise outside of simulated data. Validation set is critical!\nFlexible models often need more N holding features constant\nRegularization (unit 6) will work well when lots of features\n\n\n\n\n\n3.10.10 Transformations of numeric predictors\n\nUse of plot_truth() [predicted vs. observed]\nResiduals do not have mean of 0 for every \\(\\hat{y}\\)\n\nConsequence: biased parameter estimates. Linear is bad DGP\nAlso bad test of questions RE the predictor (underestimate? misinform)\n\nNon-normal residuals\n\nConsequence: lm parameter estimates still unbiased (for linear DGP) but more “efficient” solutions exist\nBad for prediction b/c higher variance than other solutions\nMay suggest omission of variables\n\nHeteroscasticity\n\nConsequence: Inefficient and inaccurate standard errors.\nStatistical tests wrong\nPoor prediction for some (where larger variance of residuals) \\(\\hat{y}\\)\nhigher variance overall than other solutions - bad again for prediction\n\nTransformation of outcome?\n\nmetric\nback to raw predictions\n\n\n\n\n\n3.10.11 “In GLM, why correlation/collinearity among predictors will cause larger variance?
