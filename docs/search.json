The same ones I used for the EDA unit\n\nYou will work with all of my predictors and all the predictors you used for your EDA when you do the application assignment for this unit\n\nPause for a moment to answer this question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why do we need independent validation data to select the best model configuration? In other words, why cant we just fit and evaluate all of the models in our one training set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nThese models will all overfit the dataset within which they are fit to some degree.   \nIn other words, they will predict both systematic variance (the DGP) and some noise in the training set.  However, they will differ in how much they overfit the training set.   As the models get more flexible they will have the potential to overfit to a greater degree.   Models with a larger number of features (e.g., more predictors, features based on interactions as well as raw predictors) will overfit to a greater degree.  All other things equal, the non-parametric KNN will also be more flexible than the general linear model so it may overfit to a greater degree as well if the true DGP is linear on the features.  Therefore, just because a model fits the training set well does not mean it will work well in new data because the noise will be different in every new dataset.  This overfitting will be removed from our performance estimate if we calculate it with new data (the validation set).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the available raw predictors in the training set\n\ndata_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ndata_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n10\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nfactor\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\n\noverall_qual\n0\n1\n10\n5: 424, 6: 350, 7: 304, 8: 176\n\n\ngarage_qual\n0\n1\n5\nta: 1312, no_: 81, fa: 57, gd: 13\n\n\nms_zoning\n0\n1\n7\nres: 1157, res: 217, flo: 66, com: 13\n\n\nlot_config\n0\n1\n5\nins: 1095, cor: 248, cul: 81, fr2: 39\n\n\nbldg_type\n0\n1\n5\none: 1216, tow: 108, dup: 63, tow: 46\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n1\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember from our modeling EDA that we have some issues to address as part of our feature engineering:\n\nMissing values\nPossible transformation of sale_price\nPossible transformation of other numeric predictors\nWe will need to use some feature engineering techniques to handle categorical variables\nWe may need to consider interactions among features\n\nAll of this will be accomplished with a recipe\nBut first, let’s discuss/review our first statistical algorithm"

    "text": "3.2 The Simple (General) Linear Model (LM)\nWe will start with only a quick review of the use of the simple (one feature) linear model (LM) as a machine learning model because you should be very familiar with this statistical model at this point\n\n\\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\epsilon\\)\n\nApplied to our regression problem, we might fit a model such as:\n\n\\(sale\\_price = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*gr\\_liv\\_area + \\epsilon\\)\n\nThe (general) linear model is a parametric model.

You can see how the unique effect of `gr_liv_area` \nis smaller than its overall effect from the simple regression.   This also means \nthat the overall predictive strength of the model will not be a sum of the effects \nof each predictor considered in isolation - it will likely be less.  Also, if the \ncorrelations are high, problems with multicollinearity will emerge.  This will yield \nlarge standard errors which means that the models will start to have more variance when \nfit in different training datasets!  We will soon learn about other regularized \nversions of the GLM that do not have these issues with correlated predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow well does this more complex model perform in validation? Let’s compare the previous and current visualizations of \\(sale\\_price\\) vs. \\(\\hat{sale\\_price}\\)\n\nLooks like the errors are smaller (closer to the diagonal line that would represent prefect prediction)\nClear signs of non-linearity are now present as well.

    "text": "3.7 KNN Regression\nK Nearest Neighbor\n\nIs a non-parametric regression and classification statistical algorithm\n\nIt does not yield specific parameter estimates for features/predictors (or statistical tests for those parameter estimates)\nThere are still ways to use it to address explanatory questions (visualizations, model comparisons, feature importance)\n\nVery simple but also powerful (listed commonly among top 10 algorithms)\n\nBy powerful, it is quite flexible and can accommodate many varied DGPs without the need for much feature engineering with its predictors\nMay not need most transformations of X or Y\nMay not need to model interactions\nStill need to handle missing data, outliers, and categorical predictors\n\n\n\nK Nearest Neighbor\n\nAlgorithm “memorizes” the training set (lazy learning)\n\nLazy learning is most useful for large, continuously changing datasets with few attributes (features) that are commonly queried (e.g., online recommendation systems)\n\nPrediction for any new observation is based on \\(k\\) most similar observations from the dataset\n\n\\(k\\) provides direct control over the bias-variance trade-off for this algorithm\n\n\n\nTo better understand KNN let’s simulate training data for three different DGPs (linear - y, polynomial - y2, and step - y3)\n\nLet’s start with a simple example where the DGP for Y is linear on one predictor (X)\nDGP: \\(y = rnorm(150, x, 10)\\)\nThis figure displays:\n\nDGP\nPrediction line from a simple linear model\nRed lines to represent three new observations (X = 10, 50, 90) we want to make predictions for via a standard KNN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What would 5-NN predictions look like for each of these three new values of X in the figure above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nFor x = 10, find the five observations that have X values closest to 10.  Average the \nY values for those 5 observations and that is your predicted Y associated with \nthat new value of X.  Repeat to make predictions for Y for any other value of X,\ne.g., 50, 90, or any other value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKNN can easily accommodate non-linear relationships between numeric predictors and outcomes without any feature engineering for predictors\nIn fact, it can flexibly handle any shape of relationship\nDGP: \\(y2 = rnorm(150, x^4 / 800000, 8)\\)\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDGP: \\(y3 = if\\_else(x &lt; 40, rnorm(150, 25, 10), rnorm(150, 75, 10))\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.1 The hyperparameter k\nKNN is our first example of a statistical algorithm that includes a hyperparameter, in this case \\(k\\)\n\nAlgorithm hyperparameters differ from parameters in that they cannot be estimated while fitting the algorithm to the training set\nThey must be set in advance\nk = 5 is the default for kknn(), the engine from the kknn package that we will use to fit a KNN within tidymodels.\n\n\\(kknn()\\) weights observations (neighbors) based on distance.\n\nAn option exists for unweighted as well but not likely used much (default is optimal weighting, use it!).\n\n\n\nUsing the polynomial DGP above, let’s look at a 5-NN yields\n\nNote the new category of algorithm, new engine, and the need to set a mode (because KNN can be used for regression and classification)\nWe can look in the package documentation to better understand what is being done (?kknn::train.kknn).\n\n\nnearest_neighbor() |&gt;   \n  set_engine(\"kknn\") |&gt;   \n  set_mode(\"regression\") |&gt; \n  translate()\n\nK-Nearest Neighbor Model Specification (regression)\n\nComputational engine: kknn \n\nModel fit template:\nkknn::train.kknn(formula = missing_arg(), data = missing_arg(), \n    ks = min_rows(5, data, 5))\n\n\n\n\nSet up simple feature engineering recipe and get training features (nothing happening but let’s follow normal routine anyway)\n\n\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(y2 ~ x, data = data_trn_demo)\n\nrec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt; \n  prep(data_trn_demo)\n\nfeat_trn_demo &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_trn_demo)\n\n\n\nFit 5NN\n\n\nfit_5nn_demo &lt;- \n  nearest_neighbor() |&gt;   \n  set_engine(\"kknn\") |&gt;   \n  set_mode(\"regression\") |&gt; \n  fit(y2 ~ ., data = feat_trn_demo)\n\n\n\nGet a validation set (a new sample using same polynomial DGP)\n\n\ndata_val_demo &lt;- tibble(x = runif(200, 1, 100),\n               y = rnorm(200, x, 10),\n               y_dgp = rnorm(200, x ,0),\n               y2 = rnorm(200, x^4 / 800000, 8),\n               y2_dgp = rnorm(200, x^4 / 800000 ,0),\n               y3 = if_else(x &lt; 40, rnorm(200, 25, 10),  rnorm(200, 75, 10)),\n               y3_dgp = if_else(x &lt; 40, rnorm(200, 25, 0),  rnorm(200, 75, 0)))\n\nfeat_val_demo &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_val_demo)\n\n\n\nDisplay 5NN predictions in validation\n\nKNN (with k = 5) does a pretty good job of representing the shape of the DGP (low bias)\nKNN displays some (but minimal) evidence of overfitting\nSimple linear model does not perform well (clear/high bias)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s pause and consider our conceptual understanding of the impact of \\(k\\) on the bias-variance trade-off\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How will the size of k influence model performance (e.g., bias, overfitting/variance)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nSmaller values of $k$ will tend to increase overfitting (and therefore variance \nacross training samples) but decrease bias.  Larger values of k will tend to decrease\noverfitting but increase bias.

Therefore it is very dependent on the training \nset (high variance).  It will fit both the DGP and the noise in the training set.  \nClearly it will likely not do as well in validation (it will be overfit to training).  \nk needs to be larger if there is more noise (to average over more cases).  k needs \nto be smaller if the relationships are complex.

We need to put all features on the same scale\n\nScale all features to SD = 1 (using step_scale(all_numeric_predictors()))\nRange correct [0, 1] all features (using step_range(all_numeric_predictors()))\n\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Categorical Predictors\nKNN requires numeric features (for distance calculation).\n\nFor categorical predictors, you will need to use dummy coding or other feature engineering that results in numeric features.\ne.g., step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())\n\n\n\n\n3.7.5 KNN with Ames Housing Prices\nLet’s use KNN with Ames\n\nTrain a model using only numeric predictors and overall_qual as numeric\nUse the default k = 5 algorithm\nSet SD = 1 for all features\n\n\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(sale_price ~ gr_liv_area + lot_area + year_built + garage_cars + overall_qual, \n         data = data_trn) |&gt; \n  step_impute_median(garage_cars) |&gt; \n  step_mutate(overall_qual = as.numeric(overall_qual)) |&gt; \n1  step_scale(all_numeric_predictors())\n\n\n1\n\nRemember to take advantage of these selectors for easier code!

    "text": "As you know, the estimation procedure in linear models is OLS. Parameter estimates are derived to minimize the SSE in the data set in which they are derived. For this reason, adding a predictor will never increase RMSE in the training set and it will usually lower it even when it is not part of the DGP. However, this is not true in validation. A predictor will only meaningfully lower RMSE in validation if it is part of the DGP. Also, a bad predictor could even increase RMSE in validation due to overfitting.↩︎\nFor x = 10, find the five observations that have X values closest to 10. Average the Y values for those 5 observations and that is your prediction (\\(\\hat{Y}\\)) associated with that new value of X. Repeat to make predictions for \\(\\hat{Y}\\) for any other value of X, e.g., 50, 90, or any other value↩︎\nSmaller values of \\(k\\) will tend to increase overfitting (and therefore variance across training samples) but decrease bias. Larger values of k will tend to decrease overfitting but increase bias. We need to find the Goldilocks “sweet spot”↩︎\n\\(k\\) = 1 will perfectly fit the training set. Therefore it is very dependent on the training set (high variance). It will fit both the DGP and the noise in the training set. Clearly it will likely not do as well in validation (it will be overfit to training). \\(k\\) needs to be larger if there is more noise (to average over more cases). \\(k\\) needs to be smaller if the relationships are complex. (More on choosing \\(k\\) by resampling in unit 5.↩︎"

    "text": "3.4 Extension to Categorical Predictors\nMany important predictors in our models may be categorical (nominal and some ordinal predictors)\n\nSome statistical algorithms (e.g., random forest) can accept even nominal predictors as features without any further feature engineering\nBut many cannot. Linear models cannot.\nThe type of feature engineering may differ for nominal vs. ordinal categorical predictors\nFor nominal categorical predictors:\n\nWe need to learn a common approach to transform them to numeric features - dummy coding. We will learn the concept in general AND how to accomplish within a feature engineering recipe.\n\nFor ordinal predictors:\n\nWe can treat them like numeric predictors\nWe can treat them like nominal categorical predictors\n\nSee article on Categorical Predictors on the tidymodels website for more details\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Dummy Coding\nFor many algorithms, we will need to use feature engineering to convert a categorical predictor to numeric features. One common technique is to use dummy coding. When dummy coding a predictor, we transform the original categorical predictor with m levels into m-1 dummy coded features.\nTo better understand how and why we do this, lets consider a version of ms_zoning in the Ames dataset.\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; \n  table()\n\n\n    agri   commer    float    indus res_high  res_low  res_med \n       2       13       66        1        9     1157      217 \n\n\nWe will recode ms_zoning to have only 3 levels to make our example simple (though dummy codes can be used for predictors with any number of levels)\n\ndata_dummy &lt;- data_trn |&gt; \n1  select(sale_price, ms_zoning)  |&gt;\n2  mutate(ms_zoning3 = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\",\n                                                   \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n3                                 \"floating\" = \"float\")) |&gt;\n4  select(-ms_zoning)\n\n\n1\n\nMake a df (dataframe) with only sale_price and ms_zoning\n\n2\n\nfct_collapse() from the forcats package is our preferred way to collapse levels of a factor. See fct_recode() for more generic recoding of levels.\n\n3\n\nWe could have left this line out and float would have stayed as a level named float\n\n4\n\nRemove original ms_zoning predictor\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the new predictor\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  pull(ms_zoning3) |&gt; \n  table() \n\n\n commercial    floating residential \n         16          66        1383 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why can’t we simply recode each level with a different consecutive value (e.g., commercial = 1, floating =2 , residential = 3)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nThere is no meaningful way to order the numbers that we assign to the levels of \nthis unordered categorical predictor.  The shape and strength of the relationship\nbetween it and sale_price will completely change based on arbitrary ordering of \nthe levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine fitting a straight line to predict sale_price from ms_zoning3 using these three different ways to arbitrarily assign numbers to levels.\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 3,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 2)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nDummy coding resolves this issue.\n\nWhen using dummy codes, we transform (i.e., feature engineer) our original m-level categorical predictor to m-1 dummy features.\nEach of these m-1 features represents a contrast between a specific level of the categorical variable and a reference level\nThe full set of m-1 features represents the overall effect of the categorical predictor variable.\nWe assign values of 0 or 1 to each observation on each feature in a meaningful pattern (see below)\n\n\nFor example, with our three-level predictor: ms_zoning3\n\nWe need 2 dummmy features (d1, d2) to represent this 3-level categorical predictor\nDummy feature 1 is coded 1 for residential and 0 for all other levels\nDummy feature 2 is coded 1 for floating and 0 for all other levels\n\nHere is this coding scheme displayed in a table\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  ms_zoning3     d1    d2\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 commercial      0     0\n2 residential     1     0\n3 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nWith this coding:\n\nCommercial properties are coded 0 for both d1 and d2.\n\nThis means that commercial properties will become the reference level against which both residential and floating village are compared.\nBecause we are focused on prediction, the choice of reference level is mostly arbitrary. For explanatory goals, you might consider which level is best suited to be the reference.\nThere is much deeper coverage of dummy and other contrast coding in 610/710\n\n\nWe can add these two features manually to the data frame and view a handful of observations to make this coding scheme more concrete\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  sale_price ms_zoning3     d1    d2\n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     105000 residential     1     0\n2     126000 residential     1     0\n3      13100 commercial      0     0\n4     115000 residential     1     0\n5     149500 floating        0     1\n6      40000 commercial      0     0\n7     120000 residential     1     0\n8     151000 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nIf we now fit a model where we predict sale_price from these two dummy coded features, each feature would represent the contrast of the mean sale_price for the level coded 1 vs. the mean sale_price for the level that is coded 0 for all features (i.e., commercial)\n\nd1 is the contrast of mean sale_price for residential vs. commercial\nd2 is the contrast of mean sale_price for floating vs. commercial\nThe combined effect of these two features represents the overall effect of ms_zoning3 on sale_price\n\n\nLets do this quickly in base R using lm() as you have done previously in 610.\n\nm &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ d1 + d2, data = data_dummy) \n\nm |&gt; summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ d1 + d2, data = data_dummy)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-166952  -50241  -20241   31254  565259 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This would also prevent a linear model from fitting (‘dummy variable trap’).\nHowever, some statistical algorithms do not have problems with perfect multicollinearity (e.g., LASSO, ridge regression).\n\nFor these algorithms, you will sometimes see modified version of dummy coding called one-hot coding.\n\nThis approach uses one additional dummy coded feature for the final category.\n\nWe won’t spend time on this but you should be familiar with the term b/c it is often confused with dummy coding.\n\n\n\nCoding Sidebar\nWhen creating dummy coded features from factors that have levels with infrequent observations, you may occasionally end up with novel levels in your validation or test sets that were not present in your training set.\n\nThis will cause you issues.\n\nThese issues are mostly resolved if you make sure to explicitly list all possible levels for a factor when classing that factor in the training data, even if the level doesn’t exist in the training data.\n\nWe provide more detail on this issue in an appendix.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Nominal Predictors\nNow that we understand how to use dummy coding to feature engineer nominal predictors, let’s consider some potentially important ones that are available to us.\nWe can discuss if any look promissing.\n\nLets return first to ms_zoning\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"ms_zoning\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nWe might:\n\nRepresent it with 6 dummy features (because there are 7 raw levels) but many of the categories are very low n - won’t account for much variance?\nCombine all the commercial categories (agri, commer, indus), which would take care of most of the low n groups. They also all tend to have the lower prices.\nCombine all the residential to get a better feature to variance accounted ratio.

We can now do this formally in a recipe so that it can be used in our modeling workflow.\n\nFirst, if you noticed earlier, there are some levels for ms_zoning that are pretty infrequent. Lets make sure both data_trn and data_val have all levels set for this factor.\n\n\ndata_trn |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"agri\"     \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\ndata_val |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\n\n\nAs expected, we are missing a level (agri) in data_val. Lets fix that here\n\n\ndata_val &lt;- data_val |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning = factor(ms_zoning, \n                            levels = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"float\", \"indus\", \n                                       \"res_high\", \"res_low\", \"res_med\")))\n\n[Note: Ideally, you would go back to cleaning EDA and add this level to the full dataset and then re-split into training, validation and test. This is a sloppy shortcut!]\n\nWith that fixed, let’s proceed:\n\nWe will collapse categories down to three levels (commercial, residential, floating village) as before but now using step_mutate() combined with fct_collapse() to do this inside of our recipe.\n\nWe will convert to dummy features using step_dummy(). The first level of the factor will be set to the reference level when we call step_dummy().\nstep_dummy() is a poor choice for function name.

For example, you could make dummy variables out of all of your factors in one step using step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()).\nSee the Step Functions - Dummy Variables and Encoding section on the tidymodels website for additional useful functions.\nWe have also described these in the section on factor steps in Appendix 1\n\nLet’s see if the addition of ms_zoning helped\n\nNotice the addition of the dummy coded features to the feature matrix\nNotice the removal of the factor ms_zoning\n\n\nrec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt; \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_trn)\n\nfeat_val &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_val)\n\n\n\nskim\n\n\nfeat_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n7\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n0\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\nms_zoning_floating\n0\n1\n0.05\n0.21\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n4.38\n17.22\n\n\nms_zoning_residential\n0\n1\n0.94\n0.23\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n-3.86\n12.90\n\n\n\n\nfeat_val |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_val\n\n\nNumber of rows\n490\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n7\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1493.00\n483.78\n480\n1143.5\n1436.0\n1729.50\n3608\n0.92\n1.16\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10462.08\n10422.55\n1680\n7500.0\n9563.5\n11780.75\n215245\n15.64\n301.66\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.08\n30.96\n1875\n1954.0\n1975.0\n2000.00\n2010\n-0.66\n-0.41\n\n\ngarage_cars\n0\n1\n1.74\n0.76\n0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.00\n4\n-0.24\n0.22\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n178512.82\n75493.59\n35311\n129125.0\n160000.0\n213000.00\n556581\n1.42\n2.97\n\n\nms_zoning_floating\n0\n1\n0.05\n0.22\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.00\n1\n4.07\n14.58\n\n\nms_zoning_residential\n0\n1\n0.93\n0.25\n0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.00\n1\n-3.51\n10.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets fit a model with these features\n\n\nfit_lm_6 &lt;- \n  linear_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"lm\") |&gt; \n  fit(sale_price ~ ., data = feat_trn)\n\n\n\nplot it\n\n\nplot_truth(truth = feat_val$sale_price, \n           estimate = predict(fit_lm_6, feat_val)$.pred)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd evaluate it\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  model                              rmse_val\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 simple linear model                  51375.\n2 4 feature linear model               39903.\n3 4 feature linear model with YJ       41660.\n4 6 feature linear model w/ms_zoning   39846.\n\n\n\nRemoving Yeo Johnson transformation but adding dummy coded ms_zoning may have helped a little\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Will the addition of new predictors/features to a model always reduce RMSE in train? in validation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Answer\nAs you know, the estimation procedure in linear models is OLS.  Parameter estimates\nare derived to minimize the SSE in the data set in which they are derived.  For this\nreason, adding a predictor will never increase RMSE in the training set and it will\nusually lower it even when it is not part of the DGP.   However, this is not true in\nvalidation.  A predictor will only meaningfully lower RMSE in validation if it is\npart of the DGP.  Also, a bad predictor could even increase RMSE in validation due to\noverfitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Ordinal Predictors\nWe have two paths to pursue for ordinal predictors\n\nWe can treat them like nominal predictors (e.g., dummy code)\nWe can treat them like numeric predictors (either raw or with an added transformation if needed)\n\n\nLet’s consider overall_qual\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"overall_qual\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nObservations:\n\nLow frequency for low and to some degree high quality response options. If dummy coding, may want to collapse some (1-2)\nThere is a monotonic relationship (mostly linear) with sale_price. Treat as numeric?\nNot skewed so doesn’t likely need to be transformed if treated as numeric\nNumeric will take one feature vs. many (9?) features for dummy codes.\n\nDummy codes are more flexible but we may not need this flexibility (and unnecessary flexibility increases overfitting)\n\n\nLet’s add overall_qual to our model as numeric\nRemember that this predictor was ordinal so we paid special attention to the order of the levels when we classed this factor. Lets confirm they are in order\n\ndata_trn |&gt; pull(overall_qual) |&gt; levels()\n\n [1] \"1\"  \"2\"  \"3\"  \"4\"  \"5\"  \"6\"  \"7\"  \"8\"  \"9\"  \"10\"\n\n\n\nTo convert overall_qual to numeric (with levels in the specified order), we can use another simple mutate inside our recipe.\n\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(sale_price ~  ~ gr_liv_area + lot_area + year_built + garage_cars + \n           ms_zoning + overall_qual, data = data_trn) |&gt; \n  step_impute_median(garage_cars) |&gt; \n  step_mutate(ms_zoning = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\", \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n                                 \"floating\" = \"float\"),\n              overall_qual = as.numeric(overall_qual)) |&gt;\n  step_dummy(ms_zoning)\n\nCoding Sidebar\nThere is a step function called step_ordinalscore() but it requires that the factor is classed as an ordered factor. It is also more complicated than needed in our opinion. Just use as.numeric()\n\nLet’s evaluate this model\n\nMaking features\nSkipping the skim to save space (we promised we checked it previously!)\n\n\nrec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt; \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_trn)\n\nfeat_val &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_val)\n\n\n\nFitting model\n\n\nfit_lm_7 &lt;- \n  linear_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"lm\") |&gt; \n  fit(sale_price ~ ., data = feat_trn)\n\n\n\nPlotting results\n\n\nplot_truth(truth = feat_val$sale_price, \n                                 estimate = predict(fit_lm_7, feat_val)$.pred)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantifying held out error\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  model                              rmse_val\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 simple linear model                  51375.\n2 4 feature linear model               39903.\n3 4 feature linear model with YJ       41660.\n4 6 feature linear model w/ms_zoning   39846.\n5 7 feature linear model               34080.\n\n\n\nThat helped!"

    "text": "2.3 Best Practices and Other Recommendations\n\n2.3.1 Data file formats\nWe generally store data as CSV [comma-separated value] files\n\nEasy to view directly in a text editor\nEasy to share because others can use/import into any data analysis platform\nWorks with version control (e.g. git, svn)\nuse read_csv() and write_csv()\n\nExceptions include:\n\nWe may consider binary (.rds) format for very big files because read/write can be slow for csv files.\n\nBinary file format provides a very modest additional protection for sensitive data (which we also don’t share)\nuse read_rds() and write_rds()\n\nSee chapter 7 - Data Import in Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) for more details and advanced techniques for importing data using read_csv()\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Classing Variables\nWe store and class variables in R based on their data type (level of measurement).\n\nSee Wikipedia definitions for levels of measurement for a bit more precision that we will provide here.\n\nCoarsely, there are four levels:\n\nnominal: qualitative categories, no inherent order (e.g., marital status, sex, car color)\nordinal: qualitative categories (sometimes uses number), inherent order but not equidistant spacing (e.g., Likert scale; education level)\ninterval and ratio (generally treated the same in social sciences): quantitative scores, ordered, equidistant spacing. Ratio has true 0. (e.g., temperature in Celsius vs. Kelvin scales)\n\nWe generally refer to nominal and ordinal variables as categorical and interval/ratio as quantitative or numeric\n\nFor nominal variables\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors when we load them (using read_csv())\nIn some cases, we should pay attention to the order of the levels of the variable. e.g.,\n\nFor a dichotomous outcome variable, the positive/event level of dichotomous factor outcome should be first level of the factor\nThe order of levels may also matter for factor predictors (e.g., step_dummy() uses first level as reference).\n\n\n\nFor ordinal variables:\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors (just like nominal variables)\n\nIt is easier to do EDA with these variables classes as factors\nWe use standard factors (not ordered)\n\nConfirm that the order of the levels is set up correctly. This is very important for ordinal variables.\nDuring feature engineering stage, we can then either\n\nTreat as a nominal variable and create features using step_dummy()\nTreat as an interval variable using step_ordinalscore()\n\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both nominal and ordinal variable\nOrdinal variables may show non-linear relations b/c they may not be evenly spaced. In these instances, we can use feature engineering approaches that are also used for nominal variables\n\nFor interval and ratio variables:\n\nWe store these variables as numeric\nWe class these variables as numeric (either integer or double - let R decide) during the read and clean stage (They are typically already in this class when read in)\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both interval and ratio variables\nSimilar feature engineering approaches are used with both\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Data Dictionaries\nYou should always make a data dictionary for use with your data files.\n\nIdeally, these are created during the planning phase of your study, prior to the start of data collection\nStill useful if created at the start of data analysis\n\nData dictionaries:\n\nhelp you keep track of your variables and their characteristics (e.g., valid ranges, valid responses)\ncan be used by you to check your data during EDA\ncan be provided to others when you share your data (data are not generally useful to others without a data dictionary)\n\nWe will see a variety of data dictionaries throughout the course. Many are not great as you will learn.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 The Ames Housing Prices Dataset\nWe will use the Ames Housing Prices dataset as a running example this unit (and some future units and application assignments as well)\n\nYou can read more about the original dataset created by Dean DeCock\nThe data set contains data from home sales of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010\nThe original data set includes 2930 observations of sales price and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous)\nThis is the original data dictionary\nThe challenge with this dataset is to build the best possible prediction model for the sale price of the homes.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Packages and Conflicts\nFirst, lets set up our environment with functions from important packages. I strongly recommend reviewing our recommendations for best practices regarding managing function conflicts now. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future.\n\nWe set a conflicts policy that will produce errors if we have unanticipated conflicts.\nWe source a library of functions that we use for common tasks in machine learning.\n\nThis includes a function (tidymodels_conflictRules()) that sets conflict rules to allow us to attach tidymodels functions without conflicts with tidyverse functions.\n\nYou can review that function to see what it does (search for that function name at the link)\n\nThen we use that function\n\n\noptions(conflicts.policy = \"depends.ok\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true\")\ntidymodels_conflictRules()\n\n\nNext we load packages for functions that we will use regularly. There are five things to note RE best practices\n\nIf we will use a lot of functions from a package (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels), we attach the full package\nIf we will use only several functions from a package (but plan to use them repeatedly), we use the include.only parameter to just attach those functions.\nAt times, if we plan to use a single function from a package only 1-2x times, we may not even attach that function at all. Instead, we just call it using its namespace (i.e. packagename::functionname)\nIf a package has a function that conflicts with our primary packages and we don’t plan to use that function, we load the package but exclude the function. If we really needed it, we can call it with its namespace as per option 3 above.\nPay attention to conflicts that were allowed to make sure you understand and accept them. (I left the package messages and warnings in the book this time to see them. I will hide them to avoid cluttering book in later units but you should always review them.)\n\n\n1library(janitor, include.only = \"clean_names\")\n2library(cowplot, include.only = \"plot_grid\")\n3library(kableExtra, exclude = \"group_rows\")\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n4library(tidymodels)\n\n\n1\n\nAs an alternative, we could have skipped loading the package and instead called the function as janitor::clean_names()\n\n2\n\nSame is true for cowplot package\n\n3\n\nWhen loading kableExtra (which we use often), you will always need to exclude groups_rows() to prevent a conflict with dplyr package in the tidyverse\n\n4\n\nLoading tidymodels will produce conflicts unless you source and call my function tidymodels_conflictRules() (see above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Source and Other Environment Settings\nWe will also source (from github) two other libraries of functions that we use commonly for exploratory data analyses. You should review these function scripts (fun_eda.R; fun_plots.R to see the code for these functions.\n\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true\")\n\n\nFinally, we tune our environment a bit more by setting plot themes and print options that we prefer\n\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\noptions(tibble.width = Inf, tibble.print_max = Inf)\n\nAnd we set a relative path to our data. This assumes you are using an RStudio project with the path to the data relative to that project file. I’ve provided more detail elsewhere on best practices for managing files and paths.\n\npath_data &lt;- \"data\"\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Read and Glimpse Dataframe\nLets read in the data and glimpse the subset of observations we will work with in Units 2-3 and the first two application assignments.\n\n1data_all &lt;- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_raw_class.csv\"),\n2                     col_types = cols()) |&gt;\n3  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nFirst we read data using a relative path and the here::here() function. This is a replacement for file.path() that works better for both interactive use and rendering in Quarto when using projects.\n\n2\n\nWe use col_types = cols() to let R guess the correct class for each column. This suppresses messages that aren’t important at this point prior to EDA.\n\n3\n\nIt is good practice to always glimpse() data after you read it.\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 81\n$ PID               &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Cleaning\nEDA could be done using either tidyverse packages and functions or tidymodels (mostly using the recipes package.)\n\nWe prefer to use the richer set of functions available in the tidyverse (and dplyr and purrr packages in particular).\nWe will reserve the use of recipes for feature engineering only when we are building features for models that we will fit in our training sets and evaluation in our validation and test sets.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Data Leakage Issues\nData leakage refers to a mistake made by the developer of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between their training set and held-out validation or test sets\n\nTraining sets are used to fit models with different configurations\nValidation sets are used to select the best model among those with different configurations (not needed if you only have one configuration)\nTest sets are used to evaluate a best model\nWhen splitting data-sets into training, validation and test sets, the goal is to ensure that no data (or information more broadly) are shared between the three sets\n\nNo data or information from test should influence either fitting or selecting models\nTest should only be used once to evaluate a best/final model\nTrain and validation set also must be segregated (although validation sets may be used to evaluate many model configurations)\nInformation necessary for transformations and other feature engineering (e.g., means/sds for centering/scaling, procedures for missing data imputation) must all be based only on training data.\nData leakage is common if you are not careful.\n\n\nIn particular, if we begin to use test data or information about test during model fitting\n\nWe risk overfitting\nThis is essentially the equivalent of p-hacking in traditional analyses\nOur estimate of model performance will be too optimistic, which could have harmful real-world consequences.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Tidy variable names\nUse snake case for variable names\n\nclean_names() from janitor package is useful for this.\nMay need to do further correction of variable names using rename()\nSee more details about tidy names for objects (e.g., variables, dfs, functions) per Tidy Style Guide\n\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  clean_names(\"snake\")\n\ndata_all |&gt; names()\n\n [1] \"sale_price\"   \"gr_liv_area\"  \"lot_area\"     \"year_built\"   \"overall_qual\"\n [6] \"garage_cars\"  \"garage_qual\"  \"ms_zoning\"    \"lot_config\"   \"bldg_type\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Explore variable classes\nAt this point, we should class all of our variables as either numeric or factor\n\nInterval and ratio variables use numeric classes (dbl or int)\nNominal and ordinal variable use factor class\nUseful for variable selection later (e.g., where(is.numeric), where(is.factor))\n\nSubsequent cleaning steps are clearer if we have this established/confirmed now\n\nWe have a number of nominal or ordinal variables that are classed as character.\nWe have one ordinal variable (overall_qual) that is classed as numeric (because the levels were coded with numbers rather than text)\n\nread_csv() thought was numeric by the levels are coded using numbers\nThe data dictionary indicates that valid values range from 1 - 10.\n\n\ndata_all |&gt; glimpse()\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;chr&gt; \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;chr&gt; \"RL\", \"RH\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL…\n$ lot_config   &lt;chr&gt; \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Inside\", \"Inside…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;chr&gt; \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"TwnhsE\", \"TwnhsE\", \"Twnh…\n\n\n\nWe can the recode overall_qual first and set its levels\nWe can recode all the character variables to factor in one step.

It is not necessary here because overall_qual was numeric and therefore sorts in the expected order. However, if it had been numbers stored as characters, it could sort incorrectly (e.g., 1, 10, 2, 3, …). And obviously if the orders levels were names, the order would have to be specified.\n\n2\n\nWe indicate the levels here.\n\n3\n\nWe use a mutate to re-class all character data to factors. I prefer factor() to forcats::fct() because factor orders the levels alphabetically. Be aware that this could change if your code is used in a region of the world where this sorting is different.

dictionary, we see that NA for garage_qual should be coded as “no garage”. We will correct this in our data set.\nThis is a pretty poor choice on the part of the researchers who created the dataset because it becomes impossible to distinguish between NA that means no garage vs. true NA for the variable. In fact, if you later do really careful EDA on the full data set with all variables, you will see this problem likely exists in this dataset\nAnyway, let’s correct all the NA for garage_qual to “no_garage” using mutate()\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(garage_qual = fct_expand(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"),\n2         garage_qual = replace_na(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"))\n\n\n1\n\nFirst add a new level to the factor\n\n2\n\nThen recode NA to that new level\n\n\n\n\nWe will leave the NA for garage_cars as NA because its not clear if that is truly missing or not, based on further EDA not shown here.\n\nWe have one other issue with garage_qual. It is an ordinal variable but we never reviewed the order of its levels. The data dictionary indicates the levels are ordered (best to worst) as:\n\nEx (excellent)\nGd (good)\nTA (typical/average)\nFa (fair)\nPo (poor)\n\nAnd we might assume that no garage is even worse than a poor garage.

We often use anonymous functions when using the functions from the purrr package (e.g., map(), walk())\nWe use walk() from the purrr package to apply our anonymous function to all columns of the data frame at once\nJust copy this code for now\nWe will see simpler uses later that will help you understand iteration with purrr functions\nSee the chapter on iteration in R for Data Science (2e) for more info on map() and walk()\n\n\n\n\n2.4.8 Tidy Responses for Categorical Variables\nFeature engineering with nominal and ordinal variables typically involves\n\nConverting to factors (already did this!)\nOften creating dummy features from these factors\n\nThis feature engineering will use response labels for naming new features\n\nTherefore, it is a good idea to have the responses snake-cased and cleaned up a bit so that these new feature names are clean/clear.\n\nHere is an easy way to convert responses for character variables to snake case using a function (tidy_responses()) we share in fun_eda.R (reproduced here).\n\nThis uses regular expressions (regex), which will will learn about in a later unit on text processing.\nYou could expand this cleaning function if you encounter other issues that need to be cleaned in the factor levels.\n\n\ntidy_responses &lt;- function(column){\n  # replace all non-alphanumeric with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\W\", \"_\"))\n  # replace whitespace with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\s+\", \"_\"))\n  # replace multiple _ with single _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_+\", \"_\"))\n  #remove _ at end of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_$\", \"\"))\n  # remove _ at start of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\^_\", \"\"))\n  # convert to lowercase\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, tolower)\n  factor(column)\n}\n\n\nLet’s use the function\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(across(where(is.factor), tidy_responses))\n\n\n1\n\nWe use the tidy selection helper function to limit our mutate to only factors.

For example:\n\nTransforming factors into “dummy” features if needed\nLinear and non-linear transformations (e.g., log, box-cox)\nPolynomials and interactions (i.e., x1 * x1 or x1 * x2)\nMissing value imputations\n\nProper use of recipes is an important tool to prevent data leakage between train and either validation or test.\nRecipes use only information from the training set in all feature engineering\nConsider example of standardizing x1 for a feature in train vs. validation and test. Must use mean and sd from TRAIN to standardize x1 in train, validate, and test. VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n\nWe use recipes in a two step process - prep() and bake()\n\n“Prepping” a recipe involves calculating any statistics needed for the transformations that will be applied to engineer features (e.g., mean and standard deviation to normalize a numeric variable).\n\nPrepping is done with the prep() function.\nPrepping is always done only with training data. A “prepped” recipe does not derive any statistics from validation or test sets.\n\n“Baking” is the process of calculating the features\n\nBaking is done with the bake() function.\nWe used our prepped recipe when we bake.\nWhereas we only prep a recipe with training data, we can use a prepped recipe to bake features from any dataset (training, validation, or test).\n\n\n\nWe will work with recipes extensively when model building starting in unit 3\nFor now, we will only use the recipe to indicate roles as a gentle introduction.\nWe will expand on this recipe in unit 3\nRecipe syntax is very similar to generic tidyverse syntax (created by same group)\n\nActually a subset of tidyverse functions\nLess flexible/powerful but focused on our needs and easier to learn\nYou will eventually know both\n\n\nRecipes are used in Modeling scripts (which is a third type of script after cleaning and modeling EDA scripts)\n\nLets reload training again to pretend we are starting a new script\n\n\n data_trn &lt;- read_csv(file.path(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"), \n                      col_types = cols()) |&gt; \n1  class_ames() |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nRemember our function for classing!\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n\n\n\nRecipes can be used to indicate the outcome and predictors that will be used in the model\n\nCan use . to indicate all predictors\n\nCurrently, our preferred method for larger data sets\nWe can exclude some predictors later by changing their role, removing them with a later recipe step (\\(step\\_rm()\\)), or specifying a more precise formula when we fit the model\nSee Roles in Recipes for more info\n\nCan use specific names of predictors along with \\(+\\)\n\nThis is our preferred method when we have a smaller set of predictors (We will show you both approaches)\ne.g., sale_price ~ lot_area + year_built + overall_qual\n\nDo NOT indicate interactions here\n\nAll predictors are combined with +\nInteractions are specified by a later explicit feature engineering step\n\n\n\nrec &lt;- recipe(sale_price ~ ., data = data_trn)\n\nrec\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 9\n\nsummary(rec)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   variable     type      role      source  \n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;list&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 gr_liv_area  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 2 lot_area     &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 3 year_built   &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 4 overall_qual &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 5 garage_cars  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 6 garage_qual  &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 7 ms_zoning    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 8 lot_config   &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 9 bldg_type    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n10 sale_price   &lt;chr [2]&gt; outcome   original\n\n\n\n\n2.6.1 Prepping and Baking a Recipe\nLet’s make a feature matrix from the training set\nThere are two discrete (and important) steps\n\nprep()\nbake()\n\nFirst we prep the recipe using the training data\n\n1rec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt;\n2  prep(training = data_trn)\n\n\n1\n\nWe start by prepping our raw/original recipe (rec)\n\n2\n\nWe use the prep() function on on the training data.
