    "text": "Course Syllabus\n\nInstructor\nJohn Curtin\n\nOffice hours: Thursdays, 1-2 pm or by appointment in Brogden 326\nEmail: jjcurtin@wisc.edu (but please use Slack DM or channel posts for all course communications during this semester)\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistants\nMichelle Marji\n\nOffice hours: Wednesdays, 10-11 am in Brogden 391 or by appointment\nEmail: michelle.marji@wisc.edu\n\nKendra Wyant\n\nOffice hours: Mondays, 2:30-3:30 pm in Brodgen 325 or by appointment\nEmail: kpaquette2@wisc.edu\n\n\n\nCourse Website\nhttps://jjcurtin.github.io/book_iaml/\n\n\nCommunications\nAll course communications will occur in the course’s Slack workspace (https://iaml-2024.slack.com/). You should have received an invitation to join the workspace. If you have difficulty joining, please contact me by my email above. The TAs and I will respond to all Slack messages within 1 business day (and often much quicker). Please plan accordingly (e.g., weekend messages may not receive a response until Monday). For general questions about class, coding assignments, etc., please post the question to the appropriate public channel. If you have the question, you are probably not alone. For issues relevant only to you (e.g., class absences, accommodations, etc.), you can send a direct message in Slack to me. However, I may share the DM with the TAs unless you request otherwise. In general, we prefer that all course communication occur within Slack rather than by email so that it is centralized in one location.\n\n\nMeeting Times\nThe scheduled course meeting times are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 - 12:15 pm. Tuesdays are generally used by the TAs to discuss application issues from the homework or in the course more generally. Thursdays are generally led by John and used to discuss topics from the video lectures and readings.\nAll required videos, readings, and application assignments are described on the course website at the beginning of each unit.\n\n\nCourse Description\nThis course is designed to introduce students to a variety of computational approaches in machine learning. The course is designed with two key foci. First, students will focus on the application of common, “out-of-the-box” statistical learning algorithms that have good performance and are implemented in tidymodels in R. Second, students will focus on the application of these approaches in the context of common questions in behavioral science in academia and industry.\n\n\nRequisites\nStudents are required to have completed Psychology 610 with a grade of B or better or a comparable course with my consent.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nStudents will develop and refine best practices for data wrangling, general programming, and analysis in R.\nStudents will distinguish among a variety of machine learning settings: supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning, regression vs. classification\nStudents will be able to implement a broad toolbox of well-supported machine-learning methods: decision trees, nearest neighbor, general and generalized linear models, penalized models including ridge, lasso, and elastic-nets, neural nets, random forests.\nStudents will develop expertise with common feature extraction techniques for quantitative and categorical predictors.\nStudents will be able to use natural language processing approaches to extract meaningful features from text data.\nStudents will know how to characterize how well their regression and classification models perform and they will employ appropriate methodology for evaluating their: cross validation, ROC and PR curves, hypothesis testing.\nStudents will learn to apply their skills to common learning problems in psychology and behavioral sciences more generally.\n\n\n\nCourse Topics\n\nOverview of Machine Learning Concepts and Uses\nData wrangling in R using tidyverse and tidymodels\nIterations, functions, simulations in R\nRegression models\nClassification models\nModel performance metrics\nROCs\nCross validation and other resampling methods\nModel selection and regularization\nApproaches to parallel processing\nFeature engineering techniques\nNatural language processing\nTree based methods\nBagging and boosting\nNeural networks\nDimensionality reduction and feature selection\nExplanatory methods including variable importance, partial dependence plots, etc\nEthics and privacy issues\n\n\n\nSchedule\nThe course is organized around 14 weeks of academic instruction covering the following topics:\n\nIntroduction to course and machine learning\nExploratory data analysis\nRegression models\nClassification models\nResampling methods for model selection and evaluation\nRegularization and penalized models\nMidterm exam/project\nAdvanced performance metrics\nModel comparisons\nAdvanced models: Random forests and ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, stacking)\nAdvanced models: Neural networks\nNatural Language Processing I: Text processing and feature engineering\nApplications\nEthics\n\n\nThe final exam is during exam week on Tuesday May 7th from 11 - 12:15 in our normal classroom.\nThe final project is due during exam week on Wednesday May 8th at 8 pm.\n\n\n\nRequired Textbooks and Software\nAll required textbooks are freely available online (though hard copies can also be purchased if desired).

These assignments are to be done individually. Please do not share answers or code. You are also encouraged to make use of online resources (e.g., stack overflow) for assistance. All assignments will be completed using R markdown to provide both the code and documentation as might be provided to your mentor or employer to fully describe your solution. Late assignments are not accepted because problem solutions are provided immediately after the due date. Application assignments are graded on a three-point scale (0 = not completed, 1 = partially completed and/or with many errors, 2 = fully completed and at least mostly correct). Grades for each assignment will be posted by the following Monday at the latest.\n\n\nChatGPT\nI suspect you have all seen discussions of all that ChatGPT can do by now and its impact on teaching and assessment. I believe that AI like ChatGPT will eventually become an incredible tool for data scientists and programmers. As such, I view these advances with excitement. Of course, I don’t plan to assign a grade to ChatGPT so I want to make sure that we are clear on when you can and when you cannot use it. Given that I expect AI like ChatGPT to become a useful tool in our workflow as professionals, now is the time to start to learn how it can help. Therefore, you are free to use it during any of our application assignments AND the application questions on the mid-term and final exams. Code from ChatGPT is unlikely to be sufficient in either context (and my testing suggests it can be flat out wrong in some instances!) but I suspect that it will still be useful. In contrast, you CAN NOT use ChatGPT to answer the conceptual questions on the two exams or the weekly quizzes. Those questions are designed to assess your working knowledge about concepts and best practices. That information must be in YOUR head. I am not yet certain how I will administer that part of those exams (in class vs. HonorLock), but I wanted to be 100% clear that use of ChatGPT to answer those questions will be considered cheating and handled as such if detected. There will be a zero tolerance policy for such cheating. It will be reported to the Dean of Students on first offense.\n\n\nStudent Ethics\nThe members of the faculty of the Department of Psychology at UW-Madison uphold the highest ethical standards of teaching and research. They expect their students to uphold the same standards of ethical conduct. By registering for this course, you are implicitly agreeing to conduct yourself with the utmost integrity throughout the semester.\nIn the Department of Psychology, acts of academic misconduct are taken very seriously. Such acts diminish the educational experience for all involved – students who commit the acts, classmates who would never consider engaging in such behaviors, and instructors. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, cheating on assignments and exams, stealing exams, sabotaging the work of classmates, submitting fraudulent data, plagiarizing the work of classmates or published and/or online sources, acquiring previously written papers and submitting them (altered or unaltered) for course assignments, collaborating with classmates when such collaboration is not authorized, and assisting fellow students in acts of misconduct. Students who have knowledge that classmates have engaged in academic misconduct should report this to the instructor.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nInstitutional statement on diversity: “Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.” https://diversity.wisc.edu/\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nBy enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UW-Madison’s community of scholars in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest academic integrity standards. Academic misconduct compromises the integrity of the university. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these acts are examples of academic misconduct, which can result in disciplinary action. This includes but is not limited to failure on the assignment/course, disciplinary probation, or suspension. Substantial or repeated cases of misconduct will be forwarded to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for additional review. For more information, refer to http://studentconduct.wiscweb.wisc.edu/academic-integrity\n\n\nAccommodations Polices\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center syllabus statement: “The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty [me] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty [I], will work either directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student’s educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.” http://mcburney.wisc.edu/facstaffother/faculty/syllabus.php\nUW-Madison students who have experienced sexual misconduct (which can include sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and/or stalking) also have the right to request academic accommodations. This right is afforded them under Federal legislation (Title IX). Information about services and resources (including information about how to request accommodations) is available through Survivor Services, a part of University Health Services: https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/survivor-services/\n\n\nComplaints\nOccasionally, a student may have a complaint about a TA or course instructor. If that happens, you should feel free to discuss the matter directly with the TA or instructor. If the complaint is about the TA and you do not feel comfortable discussing it with the individual, you should discuss it with the course instructor. Complaints about mistakes in grading should be resolved with the TA and/or instructor in the great majority of cases. If the complaint is about the instructor (other than ordinary grading questions) and you do not feel comfortable discussing it with the individual, make an appointment to speak to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies, Professor Shawn Green, cshawngreen@wisc.edu.\nIf you have concerns about climate or bias in this class, or if you wish to report an incident of bias or hate that has occurred in class, you may contact the Chair of the Department, Professor Allyson Bennett (allyson.j.bennett@wisc.edu) or the Chair of the Psychology Department Climate & Diversity Committee, Martha Alibali (martha.alibali@wisc.edu). You may also use the University’s bias incident reporting system\n\n\nPrivacy of Student Information & Digital Tools\nThe privacy and security of faculty, staff and students’ personal information is a top priority for UW-Madison. The university carefully reviews and vets all campus-supported digital tools used to support teaching and learning, to help support success through learning analytics, and to enable proctoring capabilities. UW-Madison takes necessary steps to ensure that the providers of such tools prioritize proper handling of sensitive data in alignment with FERPA, industry standards and best practices. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA which protects the privacy of student education records), student consent is not required for the university to share with school officials those student education records necessary for carrying out those university functions in which they have legitimate educational interest. 34 CFR 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B). FERPA specifically allows universities to designate vendors such as digital tool providers as school officials, and accordingly to share with them personally identifiable information from student education records if they perform appropriate services for the university and are subject to all applicable requirements governing the use, disclosure and protection of student data.\n\n\nPrivacy of Student Records & the Use of Audio Recorded Lectures\nSee information about privacy of student records and the usage of audio-recorded lectures.\nLecture materials and recordings for this course are protected intellectual property at UW-Madison. Students in this course may use the materials and recordings for their personal use related to participation in this class. Students may also take notes solely for their personal use. If a lecture is not already recorded, you are not authorized to record my lectures without my permission unless you are considered by the university to be a qualified student with a disability requiring accommodation. [Regent Policy Document 4-1] Students may not copy or have lecture materials and recordings outside of class, including posting on internet sites or selling to commercial entities. Students are also prohibited from providing or selling their personal notes to anyone else or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the instructor’s express written permission. Unauthorized use of these copyrighted lecture materials and recordings constitutes copyright infringement and may be addressed under the university’s policies, UWS Chapters 14 and 17, governing student academic and non-academic misconduct.\n\n\nAcademic Calendar & Religious Observances\nStudents who wish to inquire about religious observance accommodations for exams or assignments should contact the instructor within the first two weeks of class, following the university’s policy on religious observance conflicts"

    "text": "1.3 More Details on Supervised Techniques\nFor supervised machine learning problems, we assume \\(Y\\) (outcome) is a function of some data generating process (DGP, \\(f\\)) involving a set of Xs (features) plus the addition of random error (\\(\\epsilon\\)) that is independent of X and with mean of 0\n\\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\)\n\nTerminology sidebar: Throughout the course we will distinguish between the raw predictors available in a dataset and the features that are derived from those raw predictors through various transformations.\n\nWe estimate \\(f\\) (the DGP) for two main reasons: prediction and/or inference (i.e., explanation per Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017)\n\\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\)\nFor prediction, we are most interested in the accuracy of \\(\\hat{Y}\\) and typically treat \\(\\hat{f}\\) as a black box\nFor inference, we are typically interested in the way that \\(Y\\) is affected by \\(X\\)\n\nWhich predictors are associated with \\(Y\\)?\nWhat is the relationship between the outcome and the features associated with each predictor. Is the overall relationship between a predictor and Y positive, negative, dependent on other predictors? What is the shape of relationship (e.g., linear or more complex)?\nDoes the model as a whole improve prediction beyond a null model (no features from predictors) or beyond a compact model?\nWe care about good (low error) predictions even when we care about inference (we want small \\(\\epsilon\\))\n\nParameter estimates from models that don’t predict well may be incorrect or at least imprecise\nThey will also be tested with low power\n\n\n\nModel error includes both reducible and irreducible error.\n\nIf we consider both \\(X\\) and \\(\\hat{f}\\) to be fixed, then:\n\n\\(E(Y - \\hat{Y})^2 = (f(X) + \\epsilon - \\hat{f}(X))^2\\)\n\\(E(Y - \\hat{Y})^2 = [f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2 + Var(\\epsilon)\\)\n\n\\([f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2\\) is reducible and \\(Var(\\epsilon)\\) is irreducible\nIrreducible error results from other important \\(X\\) that we fail to measure and from measurement error in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nIrreducible error serves as an (unknown) bounds for model accuracy (without collecting additional Xs)\nReducible error results from a mismatch between \\(\\hat{f}\\) and the true \\(f\\)\n\nThis course will focus on techniques to estimate \\(f\\) with the goal of minimizing reducible error\n\n\n1.3.1 How Do We Estimate \\(f\\)?\nTo estimate \\(f\\):\n\nWe need a sample of \\(n\\) observations of \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) that we will call our training set\nThere are two types of statistical algorithms that we can use for \\(\\hat{f}\\):\n\nParametric algorithms\nNon-parametric algorithms\n\n\n\nParametric algorithms:\n\nFirst, make an assumption about the functional form or shape of \\(f\\).\n\nFor example, the general linear model assumes: \\(f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X2 + ... + \\beta_p*X_p\\)\nNext, a model using that algorithm is fit to the training set. In other words, the parameter estimates (e.g., \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1\\)) are derived to minimize some cost function (e.g., mean squared error for the linear model)\nParametric algorithms reduce the problem of estimating \\(f\\) down to one of only estimating some set of parameters for a chosen model\nParametric algorithms often yield more interpretable models\nBut they are often not very flexible. If you chose the wrong algorithm (shape for \\(\\hat{f}\\) that does not match \\(f\\)) the model will not fit well in the training set (and more importantly not in the new test set either)\n\nTerminology sidebar: A training set is a subset of your full dataset that is used to fit a model. In contrast, a validation set is a subset that has not been included in the training set and is used to select a best model from among competing model configurations. A test set is a third subset of the full dataset that has not been included in either the training or validation sets and is used for evaluating the performance of your fitted final/best model.\n\nNon-parametric algorithms:\n\nDo not make any assumption about the form/shape of \\(f\\)\nCan fit well for a wide variety of forms/shapes for \\(f\\)\nThis flexibility comes with costs\n\nThey generally require larger n in the training set than parametric algorithms to achieve comparable performance\nThey may overfit the training set (low error in training set but much higher error in new validation or test sets)\nThey are often less interpretable\n\n\n\nGenerally:\n\nFlexibility and interpretability are inversely related\nModels need to be flexible enough to fit \\(f\\) well\nAdditional flexibility beyond this can produce overfitting\nParametric algorithms are generally less flexible than non-parametric algorithms\nParametric algorithms can become more flexible by increasing the number of features (\\(p\\) from 610/710; e.g., using more predictors, more complex, non-linear forms to when deriving features from predictors)\nParametric algorithms can be made less flexible through regularization. There are techniques to make some non-parametric algorithms less flexible as well\nYou want the sweet spot for prediction. You may want even less flexible for inference in increase interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 How Do We Assess Model Performance?\nThere is no universally best statistical algorithm\n\nDepends on the true \\(f\\) and your goal (prediction or inference)\nWe often compare multiple statistical algorithms (various parametric and non-parametric options) and model configurations more generally (combinations of different algorithms with different sets of features)\nWhen comparing models/configurations, we need to both fit these models and then select the best one\n\n\nBest needs to be defined with respect to some performance metric in new (validation or test set) data\n\nThere are many performance metrics you might use\nRoot Mean squared error (RMSE) is common for regression problems\nAccuracy is common for classification problems\n\nWe will learn many other performance metrics in a later unit\n\nTwo types of performance problems are typical\n\nModels are underfit if they don’t adequately represent the true \\(f\\), typically because they have oversimplied the relationship (e.g., linear function fit to quadratic DGP, missing key interaction terms)\n\nThis models will yield biased predictions. In other words, they will systematically either under-predict or over-predict \\(Y\\) in some regions of the function.\nBiased models will perform poorly in both training and test sets\n\nModels are overfit if they are too flexible and begin to fit the noise in the training set.\n\nThese models will perform well (too well actually) in the training set but poorly in test or validation sets\nThey will show high variance such that the model and its predictions change drastically depending on the training set where it is fit\n\n\n\nMore generally, these problems and their consequences for model performance are largely inversely related\n\nThis is known as the Bias-Variance trade-off\nWe previously discussed reducible and irreducible error\n\nReducible error can be parsed into components due to bias and variance\nGoal is to minimize the sum of bias and variance error (i.e., the reducible error overall)\nWe will often trade off a little bias if it provides a big reduction in variance"

    "section": "1.4 Key Terminology in Context",
    "text": "1.4 Key Terminology in Context\nMachine learning has emerged in parallel from developments in statistics and computer science. As a result, there is a lot of terminology and often multiple terms used for the same concept. This is not my fault! However, to help us avoid confusion, I will try to use one set of terms. In the following paragraphs, I identify these key terms in context (along with other synonymous terms used by others) and highlight them in bold.\nThere are two broad approaches in machine learning - unsupervised and supervised approaches. This course focuses primarily on developing supervised models.\n\nDeveloping a supervised machine learning model to predict or explain an outcome (also called DV, label, output) typically entails:\n\nFitting models with multiple candidate model configurations\nAssessing each model and selecting a best configuration\nEvaluating how well a model with that best configuration will perform with new observations.\n\n\nCandidate model configurations can vary with respect to the statistical algorithm used. Statistical algorithms can be coarsely categorized as parametric or non-parametric. But we will mostly focus on a more granular description of the specific algorithm itself (e.g., linear model, generalized linear model, multi-level linear model, elastic net, LASSO, ridge regression, neural network, KNN, random forest).\nThe set of candidate model configurations often includes variations of the same statistical algorithm with different hyperparameter (also called tuning parameter) values that control aspects of the algorithm’s operation. For example, the hyperparameter lambda controls the degree of regularization in penalized regression algorithms such as LASSO, ridge and elastic net. We will learn more about hyperparameters and their effects later in this course.\nThe set of candidate model configurations can vary with respect to the features that are included. A recipe describes how to transform raw data for predictors (also called IVs) into features (also called regressors, inputs) that are included in the feature matrix (also called design matrix, model matrix). This process of transforming predictors into features in a feature matrix is called feature engineering.\nCrossing variation on statistical algorithms, hyperparameter values, and alternative sets of features can increase the number of candidate model configurations dramatically; developing a machine learning model can easily involve fitting thousands of model configurations. In most implementations of machine learning, the number of candidate model configurations nearly ensures that some fitted models will overfit the dataset in which they are developed such that they capitalize on noise that is unique to the dataset in which they were fit. For this reason, model configurations are assessed and selected on the basis of their relative performance for new data (observations that were not involved in the fitting process).\n\nWe have ONE full dataset but we use resampling techniques to form subsets of that dataset to enable us to assess models’ performance in new data. Cross-validation and bootstrapping are both examples of classes of resampling techniques that we will learn in this course. Broadly, resampling techniques create multiple subsets of data random samples that consist of subsets of the full dataset. These different subsets can be used for model fitting, model selection, and model evaluation.\nTraining sets are subsets that are used for model fitting (also called model training). During model fitting, models with each candidate model configuration are fit to the data in the training set. For example, during fitting, model parameters are estimated for regression algorithms, and weights are established for neural network algorithms. Some non-parametric algorithms, like k-nearest neighbors, do not estimate parameters but simply “memorize” the training sets for subsequent predictions.\nValidation sets are subsets that are used for model selection (or, more accurately, for model configuration selection). During model selection, each (fitted) model — one for every candidate model configuration — is used to make predictions for observations in a validation set that, importantly, does not overlap with the model’s training set. On the basis of each model’s performance in the validation set, the relatively best model configuration (i.e., the configuration of the model that performs best relative to all other model configurations) is identified and selected. If you have only one model configuration, validation set(s) are not needed because there is no need to select among model configurations.\nTest sets are subsets that are used for model evaluation. Generally, a model with the previously identified best configuration is re-fit to all available data other than the test set. This fitted model is used to predict observations in the test set to estimate how well this model is expected to perform for new observations."

    "text": "1.5 An Example of Underfitting, Overfitting and the Bias-Variance Trade-off\n\n1.5.1 Overview of Example\nThe concepts of underfitting vs. overfitting and the bias-variance trade-off are critical to understand\n\nIt is also important to understand how model flexibility can affect both the bias and variance of that model’s performance\nIt can help to make these abstract concepts concrete by exploring real models that are fit in actual data\nWe will conduct a very simple simulation to demonstrate these concepts\n\nThe code in this example is secondary to understanding the concepts of underfittinng, overfitting, bias, variance, and the bias-variance trade-off\n\nWe will not display much of it so that you can maintain focus on the concepts\nYou will have plenty of time to learn the underlying\n\n\nWhen modeling, our goal is typically to approximate the data generating process (DGP) as close as possible, but in the real world we never know the true DGP.\nA key advantage of many simulations is that we do know the DGP because we define it ourselves.\n\nFor example, in this simulation, we know that y is a cubic function of x and noise (random error).\nIn fact, we know the exact equation for calculating y as a function of x.\n\n\\(y = 1100 - 4.0 * x - 0.4 * x^2 + 0.1 * (x - h)^3 + noise\\), where:\n\nb0 = 1100\nb1 = -4.0\nb2 = -0.4\nb3 = 0.1\nh = -20.0\nnoise has mean = 0 and sd = 150\n\n\n\nWe will attempt to model this cubic DGP with three different model configurations\n\nA simple linear model that uses only x as a feature\nA (20th order) polynomial linear model that uses 20 polynomials of x as features\nA (20th order) polynomial LASSO model that uses the same 20 polynomials of x as features but “regularizes” to remove unimportant features from the model\n\nIf the DGP for y is a cubic function of x, what do we know about the expected bias for our three candidate model configurations in this example? 1\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.1.0 ──\n\n✔ broom        1.0.4     ✔ rsample      1.1.1\n✔ dials        1.2.0     ✔ tune         1.1.1\n✔ infer        1.0.4     ✔ workflows    1.1.3\n✔ modeldata    1.1.0     ✔ workflowsets 1.0.1\n✔ parsnip      1.1.0     ✔ yardstick    1.2.0\n✔ recipes      1.0.6     \n\n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ scales::discard() masks purrr::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()   masks stats::filter()\n✖ recipes::fixed()  masks stringr::fixed()\n✖ dplyr::lag()      masks stats::lag()\n✖ yardstick::spec() masks readr::spec()\n✖ recipes::step()   masks stats::step()\n• Use suppressPackageStartupMessages() to eliminate package startup messages\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Stimulation Steps\nWith that introduction complete, lets start our simulation of the bias-variance trade-off\n\nWe get four random samples of training data to fit models\n\n\nIn other words, we are simulating four separate studies where the researcher in each study is trying to develop a prediction model for y using a sample of training data\nHere are plots of these four simulated training sets with a dotted line for the data generating process (DGP)\n\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get one more large random sample (N = 5000) with the same DGP to use as a test set to evaluate all the models that will be fit in the training sample across all of the simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fit the three model configurations in each of the four simulated training sets\nWe use the resulting models to make predictions for observations in the same training set in which they were fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook in any training set. Can you see evidence of bias for any model configuration? 2\nCan you see any evidence of overfitting for any model configuration? 3\n\n\nWe use these same models (3 model configurations fit to 4 different training sets) to make predictions for new observations in the test set\n\n\nRemember that the test set has NEW observations of x and y that weren’t used for fitting any of the models.\nLets look at each model configurations performance in test separately\n\n\n\nHere are predictions from the four simple linear models (fit in each of the four training sets) in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you see evidence of bias for the simple linear models? 4\nHow much variance across the simple linear models is present? 5\n\n\nHere are predictions from the four polynomial linear models in the test set\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 219 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nAre they systematically biased? 6\nHow does the variance of these models compare to the variance of the simple linear models? 7\nHow does this demonstrate the connection between model overfitting and model variance? 8\n\n\nHere are predictions from the four polynomial LASSO models in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does their bias compare to the simple and polynomial linear models? 9\nHow does their variance compare to the simple and polynomial linear models? 10\n\n\nNow we will quantify the performance of these models in training and test sets with the root mean square error performance metric. This is the standard deviation of the error when comparing the predicted values for y to the actual values (ground truth) for y.\n\nWhat do we expect about RMSE for the three models in train and test? 11\n\nTo better understand this:\n\nCompare RMSE across the three model configurations within the training sets (turquoise line)\nCompare how RMSE changes for each model configuration across its training set and the test set\nCompare RMSE across the three model configurations within the test set (red line)?\nSpecifically compare the performance of simple linear model (least flexible) with the polynomial linear model (most flexible)\n\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'model'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould these observations about bias and variance of these three model configurations always be the same regardless of the DGP? 12"

It involves both explaining behavior (i.e., identifying causes) and predicting (yet to be observed) behaviors.\n\nWe overemphasize explanatory goals in this department, IMO\n\n\n\n\n1.6.4 Data Generating Process\n\n\\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\)\nboth function and Xs are generally unknown\n\n\n\n1.6.5 Bias, Overfitting, and Variance\n\nWhat are they and how are they related?\nDescribe problem of p-hacking with respect to overfitting? 14\n\n\n\n1.6.6 Cross Validation\n\nWhat is it?\nHow are replication and cross-validation different?\n\n\n\n1.6.7 Basic framework and terminology\n\nSupervised vs. unsupervised machine learning?\nSupervised regression vs classification?\n\n\n\nWhat is a data generating process?\n\n\\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\)\nBoth function and Xs are generally unknown\n\\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\)\n\nWhy do we estimate the data generating process?\n\n\nReducible vs. Irreducible error?\n\nOur predictions will have error\nYou learned to estimate parameters in the GLM to minimize error in 610\nBut error remained non-zero (in your sample and more importantly with same model in new samples) unless you perfectly estimated the DGP\nThat error can be divided into two sources\nIrreducible error comes from measurement error in X, Y and missing X because predictors (causes) not measured.\n\nIrreducible without collecting new predictors and/or with new measures\nIt places a ceiling on the performance of the best model you can develop with your available data\n\nReducible error comes from mismatch between \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\) and the true \\(f(X)\\).\n\nWe can reduce this without new data.\n\nJust need better model (\\(\\hat{f}(X)\\)).\n\nYou didn’t consider this (much) in 610 because you were limited to one statistical algorithm (GLM) AND it didn’t have hyperparameters.\nYou did reduce error by coding predictors (feature engineering) differently (interactions \\(X1*X2\\), polynomial terms \\(X^2\\), power transformations of X) This course will teach you methods to decrease reducible error (and validly estimate total error of that best model)\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the three general steps by which we estimate and evaluate the data generating process with a sample of data? Lets use all this vocabulary!\n\nCandidate model configurations\n\nStatistical algorithms\nHyperparameters\nFeatures (vs. predictors?), feature matrix, feature engineering, recipe (tidymodels specific)\n\nModel fitting (training), selection, and evaluation\nResampling techniques\n\ncross validation techniques (k-fold)\nboostrapping\n\nTraining, validation, and test sets (terms vary in literature!)\n\n\n\n\n1.6.8 Bias-variance tradeoff\n\nWhat is underfitting, overfitting, bias, and variance?\nBias and variance are general concepts to understand during any estimation process\n\nEstimate mean, median, standard deviation\nParameter estimates in GLM\nEstimate DGP - \\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\)\n\n\n\nUseful conceptual examples of bias-variance\n\nExample 1: Darts from Yarkoni and Westfall (2017)\n\n\n\nExample 2: Models (e.g. many scales made by Acme Co.) to measure my weight\n\n\n1.6.8.1 Bias\nBiased models are generally less complex models (i.e., underfit) than the data-generating process for your outcome\n\nBiased models lead to errors in prediction because the model will systematically over- or under-predict outcomes (scores or probabilities) for specific values of predictor(s) (bad for prediction goals!)\nParameter estimates from biased models may over or under-estimate the true effect of a predictor (bad for explanatory goals!)\n\n\nAre GLMs biased models? 15\n\nBias seems like a bad thing.\n\nBoth bias (due to underfitting) and variance (due to overfitting) are sources of (reducible) prediction errors (and imprecise/inaccurate parameter estimates). They are also often inversely related (i.e., the trade-off).\nA model configuration needs to be flexible enough to represent the true DGP.\n\nAny more flexibility will lead to overfitting.\n\nAny less flexibility will lead to underfitting.\n\nIdeally, if your model configuration is perfectly matched to the DGP, it will have very low bias and very low variance (assuming sufficiently large N)\nThe world is complex. In many instances,\n\nWe can’t perfectly represent the DGP\nWe trade off a little bias for big reduction in variance to produce the most accurate predictions (and stable parameter estimates across samples for explanatory goals)\nOr we trade off a little variance (slightly more flexible model) to get a big reduction in bias\nEither way, we get models that predict well and may be useful for explanatory goals\n\n\n\n\n1.6.8.2 Overfitting - Variance\nConsider example of p = n - 1 in general linear model. What happens in this situation? How is this related to overfitting and model flexibility? 16\nFactors that increase overfitting\n\nSmall N\nComplex models (e.g, many predictors, p relative to n, non-parametric models)\nWeak effects of predictors (lots of noise available to overfit)\nCorrelated predictors (for some algorithms like the GLM)\nChoosing between many model configurations (e.g. different predictors or predictor sets, transformations, types of statistical models) - lets return to this when we consider p-hacking\n\n\nYou might have noticed that many of the above factors contribute to the standard error of a parameter estimate/model coefficient from the GLM\n\nSmall N\nBig p\nSmall \\(R^2\\) (weak effects)\nCorrelated predictors\n\nThe standard error increases as model overfitting increases due to these factors\nExplain the link between model variance/overfitting, standard errors, and sampling distributions? 17\n\nDescribe problem of p-hacking with respect to overfitting? 18\n\nParameter estimates from an overfit model are specific to the sample within which they were trained and are not true for other samples or the population as a whole\n\nParameter estimates from overfit models have big (TRUE) SE and so they may be VERY different in other samples\n\nThough if the overfitting is due to fitting many models, it won’t be reflected in the SE from any one model because each model doesn’t know the other models exist! p-hacking!!\n\nWith traditional (one-sample) statistics, this can lead us to incorrect conclusions about the effect of predictors associated with these parameter estimates (bad for explanatory goals!).\nIf the parameter estimates are very different sample to sample (and different from the true population parameters), this means the model will predict poorly in new samples (bad for prediction goals!). We fix this by using resampling to evaluate model performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 2023.

    "text": "The simple linear model will underfit the true DGP and therefore it will be biased b/c it can only represent y as a linear function of x. The two polynomial models will be generally unbiased b/c they have x represented with 20th order polynomials. LASSO will be slightly biased due to regularization but more on that in a later unit↩︎\nThe simple linear model is clearly biased. It systemically underestimates Y in some portions of the X distribution and overestimates Y in other portions of the X distribution. This is true across training sets.↩︎\nThe polynomial linear model appears to overfit the data in the training set. In other words, it seems to follow both the signal/DGP and the noise. However, you can’t be certain of this with only one training set and without knowing the DGP.\nIt is possible that the wiggles in the prediction line represent the real DGP.\nYou will need a test set to be certain about the degree of overfitting.↩︎\nYes, consistent with what we saw in the training sets, the simple linear model systematically overestimates Y in some places and underestimates it in others. The DGP is clearly NOT linear but this simple model can only make linear predictions. It is a fairly biased model that underfits the true DGP. This bias will make a large contribution to the reducible error of the model↩︎\nThere is not much variance in the prediction lines across the models that were fit to different training sets. The slopes are very close across models and the intercepts only vary by a small amount. The simple linear model configuration does not appear to have high variance and model variance will not contribute much to its reducible error.↩︎\nThere is not much systematic bias. The overall function is generally cubic as is the DGP. Bias will not contribute much to the model’s reducible error.↩︎\nThere is much higher model variance for this polynomial linear model relative to the simple linear model. Although all four models generally predict Y as a cubic function of X, there is also a non-systematic wiggle that is different for each of the models.↩︎\nModel variance is a result of overfitting to the training set. If a model fits noise in its training set, that noise will be different in every dataset. Therefore, you end up with different models depending on the training set in which they are fit. And none of those models will do well with new data as you can see in this test set because noise is random and different in each dataset.↩︎\nIt has low bias much like the polynomial linear model. It is able to capture the true cubic DGP fairly well. The regularization process slightly reduced the magnitude of the cubic (the prediction line is a little straighter than it should be) but not by much.↩︎\nIt has low variance, much like the simple linear model. All four models, fit in different training sets resulted in very similar prediction lines.↩︎\nThe simple linear model is underfit to the TRUE DGP. Therfore it is systematically biased everywhere it is use and won’t even fit train for this reason. However, it’s not very flexible so it won’t be overfit to the noise in train and therefore should fit comparably in test. The polynomial linear model won’t be biased at all given that the DGP is polynomial. However, it is overly flexible (20th order) and so will substantially overfit the training data such that it will show high variance and its performance will be poor in test. The polynomial LASSO will be the sweet spot in bias-variance trade-off. It has a little bias but not much. However, it is not as flexible due to regularization by lambda so it won’t be overfit to its training set. Therefore, it should do well in the test set.↩︎\nNo. A model configuration needs to be flexible enough and/or well designed to represent the DGP for the data that you are modeling. The two polynomial models in this example were each able to represent a cubic DGP. The simple linear model was not. The polynomial linear model was too flexible for a cubic given that it had 20 polynomials of X. Therefore, it was overfit to its training set and had high variance. However, if the DGP was a different shape, the story would be different. If the DGP was linear the simple linear model would not have been biased and would have performed best. If this DGP was some other form (step function), it may be that none of the models would work well.↩︎\nAssociation quantifies the relationship between variables within a sample (predictors-outcome). Prediction requires using an established model to predict (future?) outcomes for new (“out-of-sample,”held-out”) participants. ↩︎\nWhen you p-hack, you are overfitting the training set (your sample). You try out many, many different model configurations and choose the one you like best rather than what works well in new data. This model likely capitalizes on noise in your sample. It won’t fit well in another sample. In other words, your conclusions are not linked to the true DGP and would be different if you used a different sample. In a different vein, your significance test is wrong. The SE does not reflect the model variance that resulted from testing many different configurations b/c your final model didn’t “know” about the other models. Statistically invalid conclusion!↩︎\n“GLM parameter estimates are BLUE - best linear unbiased estimators. Parameter estimates from any sample are unbiased estimates of the linear model coefficients for population model but if DGP is not linear, this linear model will produce biased predictions and have biased parameter estimates.↩︎\nThe model will perfectly fit the sample data even when there is no relationship between the predictors and the outcome. e.g., Any two points can be fit perfectly with one predictor (line), any three points can be fit perfectly with two predictors (plane). This model will NOT predict well in new data. This model is overfit because n-1 predictors is too flexible for the linear model. You will fit the noise in the training data.↩︎\nAll parameter estimates have a sampling distribution. This is the distribution of estimates that you would get if you repeatedly fit the same model to new samples. When a model is overfit, that means that aspects of the model (its parameter estimates, its predictions) will vary greatly from sample to sample. This is represented by a large standard error (the SD of the sampling distribution) for the model’s parameter estimates. It also means that the predictions you will make in new data will be very different depending on the sample that was used to estimate the parameters.↩︎\nWhen you p-hack, you are overfitting the training set (your sample). You try out many, many different model configurations and choose the one you like best rather than what works well in new data. This model likely capitalizes on noise in your sample. It won’t fit well in another sample. In other words, your conclusions are not linked to the true DGP and would be different if you used a different sample. In a different vein, your significance test is wrong. The SE does not reflect the model variance that resulted from testing many different configurations b/c your final model didn’t “know” about the other models. Statistically invalid conclusion!↩︎"

    "text": "2.2 Overview of Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n2.2.1 Stages of Data Analysis and Model Development\nThese are the main stages of data analysis for machine learning and the data that are used\n\nEDA: Cleaning (full dataset)\nEDA: Split data into training, validation and test set(s)\nEDA: Modeling (training sets)\nModel Building: Feature engineering (training sets)\nModel Building: Fit many models configurations (training set)\nModel Building: Evaluate many models configurations (validation sets)\nFinal Model Evaluation: Select final/best model configuration (validation sets)\nFinal Model Evaluation: Fit best model configuration (use both training and validation sets)\nFinal Model Evaluation: Evaluate final model configuration (test sets)\nFinal Model Evaluation: Fit best model configuration to ALL data (training, validation, and test sets) if you plan to use it for applications.\n\nThe earlier stages are highly iterative:\n\nYou may iterate some through EDA stages 1-3 if you find further errors to clean in stage 3 [But make sure you resplit into the same sets]\nYou will iterate many times though stages 3-6 as you learn more about your data both through EDA for modeling and evaluating actual models in validation\n\nYou will NOT iterate back to earlier stages after you select a final model configuration\n\nStages 7 - 10 are performed ONLY ONCE\nOnly one model configuration is selected and re-fit and only that model is brought into test for evaluation\nAny more than this is essentially equivalent to p-hacking in traditional analyses\nStep 10 only happens if you plan to use the model in some application\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Data file formats\nWe generally store data as CSV [comma-separated value] files\n\nEasy to view directly in a text editor\nEasy to share because others can use/import into any data analysis platform\nWorks with version control (e.g. git, svn)\nuse read_csv() and write_csv()\n\nExceptions include:\n\nWe may consider binary (.rds) format for very big files because read/write can be slow for csv files.\n\nBinary file format provides a modest additional protection for sensitive data (which we also don’t share)\nuse read_rds() and write_rds()\n\nSee chapter 7 - Data Import in Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) for more details and advanced techniques for importing data using read_csv()\n\n\n2.2.3 Classing Variables\nWe store and class variables in R based on their data type.\nFor nominal variables:\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors when we load them (using read_csv())\nIn some cases, we should pay attention to the order of the levels of the variable. e.g.,\n\nFor a dichotomous outcome variable, the positive/event level of dichotomous factor outcome should be first level of the factor\nThe order of levels may also matter for factor predictors (e.g., step_dummy() uses first level as reference).\n\n\nFor ordinal variables:\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors (just like nominal variables)\n\nIt is easier to do EDA with these variables classes as factors\nWe use standard factors (not ordered)\n\nConfirm that the order of the levels is set up correctly. This is very important for ordinal variables.\nDuring feature engineering stage, we can then either\n\nTreat as a nominal variable and create features using step_dummy()\nTreat as an interval variable using step_ordinalscore()\n\n\nFor interval and ratio variables:\n\nWe store these variables as numeric\nWe class these variables as numeric (either integer or double - let R decide) during the read and clean stage (They are typically already in this class when read in)\n\n\nWe will refer to both nominal and ordinal variables as categorical variables\n\nThey are stored as character\nThey are classed as factors\nThey include a limited number of unique responses\nWe can indicate the order of the levels\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both\nOrdinal variables may show non-linear relations b/c they may not be evenly spaced. In these instances, we can use feature engineering approaches that are also used for nominal variables\n\nWe will often refer to interval and ratio variables as numeric variables\n\nThe are stored as numeric\nThey are classed with one of two numeric data types\nThey have many (infinite?) unique responses\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both\nSimilar feature engineering approaches are used with both\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Data Dictionaries\nYou should always make a data dictionary for use with your data files.\n\nIdeally, these are created during the planning phase of your study, prior to the start of data collection\nStill useful if created at the start of data analysis\n\nData dictionaries:\n\nhelp you keep track of your variables and their characteristics (e.g., valid ranges, valid responses)\ncan be used by you to check your data during EDA\ncan be provided to others when you share your data (data are not generally useful to others without a data dictionary)\n\nWe will see a variety of data dictionaries throughout the course. Many are not great as you will learn.\n\n\n2.2.5 The Ames Housing Prices Dataset\nWe will use the Ames Housing Prices dataset as a running example this unit (and some future units and application assignments as well)\n\nYou can read more about the original dataset created by Dean DeCock\nThe data set contains data from home sales of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010\nThe original data set includes 2930 observations of sales price and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous)\nThis is the original data dictionary\nThe challenge with this dataset is to build the best possible prediction model for the sale price of the homes.\n\n\nFirst, lets set up our environment with functions from important packages. I strongly recommend reviewing our recommendations for best practices regarding managing function conflicts now. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future.\n\nFirst we set a conflicts policy that will produce errors if we have unanticipated conflicts.\nWe next source a library of functions that we use for common tasks in machine learning. This includes a function (tidymodels_conflictRules()) that sets conflict rules to allow us to attach tidymodels functions without conflicts with tidyverse functions. You can review that function to see what it does (search for that function name at the link)\nThen we use that function\n\n\noptions(conflicts.policy = \"depends.ok\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true\")\n\nℹ SHA-1 hash of file is \"175d942e14f108d74912bfb2593b77637328ecb1\"\n\ntidymodels_conflictRules()\n\nNow we load packages for functions that we will use regularly. There are five things to note RE best practices\n\nIf we will use a lot of functions from a package (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels), we attach the full package\nIf we will use only several functions from a package (but plan to use them repeatedly), we use the include.only parameter to just attach those functions.\nAt times, if we plan to use a single function from a package only 1-2x times, we may not even attach that function at all. Instead, we just call it using its namespace (i.e. packagename::functionname)\nIf a package has a function that conflicts with our primary packages and we don’t plan to use that function, we load the package but exclude the function. If we really needed it, we can call it with its namespace as per option 3 above.\nPay attention to conflicts that were allowed to make sure you understand and accept them. (I left the package messages and warnings in the book this time to see them. I will hide them to avoid cluttering book in later units but you should always review them.)\n\n\nlibrary(janitor, include.only = \"clean_names\")\nlibrary(cowplot, include.only = \"plot_grid\") # for plot_grid()\nlibrary(kableExtra, exclude = \"group_rows\") # exclude dplyr conflict\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for general data wrangling\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(tidymodels) # for modeling\n\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.1.0 ──\n✔ broom        1.0.4     ✔ rsample      1.1.1\n✔ dials        1.2.0     ✔ tune         1.1.1\n✔ infer        1.0.4     ✔ workflows    1.1.3\n✔ modeldata    1.1.0     ✔ workflowsets 1.0.1\n✔ parsnip      1.1.0     ✔ yardstick    1.2.0\n✔ recipes      1.0.6     \n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ scales::discard() masks purrr::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()   masks stats::filter()\n✖ recipes::fixed()  masks stringr::fixed()\n✖ dplyr::lag()      masks stats::lag()\n✖ yardstick::spec() masks readr::spec()\n✖ recipes::step()   masks stats::step()\n• Learn how to get started at https://www.tidymodels.org/start/\n\n\nThen we source (from github) two other libraries of functions that we use commonly for exploratory data analyses. You should review these function scripts to see how I’ve written this code.\n\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true\")\n\nℹ SHA-1 hash of file is \"c045eee2655a18dc85e715b78182f176327358a7\"\n\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true\")\n\nℹ SHA-1 hash of file is \"def6ce26ed7b2493931fde811adff9287ee8d874\"\n\n\nFinally, we tune our environment a bit more by setting plot themes and print options\n\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\noptions(tibble.width = Inf,\n        pillar.bold = TRUE)\n\nAnd we set a relative path to our data. This assumes you are using an RStudio project with the path to the data relative to that project file. I’ve provided more detail elsewhere on best practices for managing files and paths.\n\npath_data &lt;- \"data\"\n\nHere is a quick glimpse of the subset of observations we will work with in Units 2-3 and the first two application assignments. Note that we re-class all character variables as unordered factors for now\n\n1data_all &lt;- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_raw_class.csv\"),\n2                     col_types = cols()) |&gt;\n3  mutate(across(where(is.character), factor)) |&gt;\n4  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nFirst we read data using a relative path and the here::here() function. This is a replacement for file.path() that works better for both interactive use and rendering in Quarto when using projects.\n\n2\n\nWe use col_types = cols() to let R guess the correct class for each column. This suppresses messages that aren’t important at this point prior to EDA.\n\n3\n\nThen we use a mutate to re-class all character data to factors. This should handle most of our nominal and ordinal variables. We may need to still class some that were missed because they appeared to be numeric. I prefer factor() to forcats::fct() because factor orders the levels alphabetically. Be aware that this could change if your code is used in a region of the world where this sorting is different. I still prefer this to the alternative (in fct()) that orders by the order the levels are found in your data.\n\n4\n\nIt is good practice to always glimpse() data after you read it.\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 81\n$ PID               &lt;fct&gt;

    "text": "2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Cleaning\nEDA could be done using either tidyverse packages and functions or tidymodels (mostly using the recipes package.)\n\nWe prefer to use the richer set of functions available in the tidyverse (and dplyr and purrr packages in particular).\nWe will reserve the use of recipes for feature engineering only when we are building features for models that we will fit in our training sets and evaluation in our validation and test sets.\n\n\n2.3.1 Data Leakage Issues\nData leakage refers to a mistake made by the creator of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between their training set and held-out validation or test sets\n\nTraining sets are used to fit models with different configurations\nValidation sets are used to select the best model among those with different configurations (not needed if you only have one configuration)\nTest sets are used to evaluate a best model\nWhen splitting data-sets into training, validation and test sets, the goal is to ensure that no data (or information more broadly) are shared between the three\n\nNo data or information from test should influence either fitting or selecting models\nTest should only be used once to evaluate a best/final model\nTrain and validation set also must be segregated (although validation sets may be used to evaluate many models)\nInformation necessary for transformations and other feature engineering (e.g., means/sds for centering/scaling, procedures for missing data imputation) must all be based only on training data.\nData leakage is common if you are not careful.\n\n\nIn particular, if we begin to use test data or information about test during model fitting\n\nWe risk overfitting\nThis is essentially the equivalent of p-hacking in traditional analyses\nWill report too optimistic performance estimate, which could have harmful real-world consequences.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Tidy variable names\nUse snake case for variable names\n\nclean_names() from janitor package is useful for this.\nMay need to do further correction of variable names using rename()\nSee more details about tidy names for objects (e.g., variables, dfs, functions) per Tidy Style Guide\n\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  clean_names(\"snake\")\n\ndata_all |&gt; names()\n\n [1] \"sale_price\"   \"gr_liv_area\"  \"lot_area\"     \"year_built\"   \"overall_qual\"\n [6] \"garage_cars\"  \"garage_qual\"  \"ms_zoning\"    \"lot_config\"   \"bldg_type\"   \n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Explore variable classes\nAt this point, variables should be classed as either numeric or factor\n\nInterval and ratio variables use numeric classes (dbl or int)\nNominal and ordinal variable use factor class\nUseful for variable selection later (e.g., where(is.numeric), where(is.factor))\n\nSubsequent cleaning steps are clearer if we have this established/confirmed now\n\nWe have one variable to change to factor class\n\ndata_all |&gt; glimpse()\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, T…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; RL, RH, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, R…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; Corner, Inside, Corner, Inside, Inside, Inside, Inside, I…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, 1Fam, 1Fa…\n\n\noverall_qual is ordinal.\n* We should convert it to a factor and confirm the levels are ordered properly.\n* The data dictionary indicates that valid values range from 1 - 10.\n\n1oq_levels &lt;- 1:10\n\nt &lt;-  data_all |&gt; \n  mutate(overall_qual = factor(overall_qual, \n2                               levels = oq_levels)) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nIt is always best to explicitly set the levels of an ordinal factor in the order you prefer.

created a function (print_kbl()) from scratch (rather than using a function factory)\nSee functions chapter in Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) for help.\nSee functionals chapter in Wickham (2019).\n\n\nIn this instance, if we consult our data dictionary, we see that NA for garage_qual should be coded as “no garage”. We will correct this in our data set.\nThis is a pretty poor choice on the part of the researchers who created the dataset because it becomes impossible to distinguish between NA that means no garage vs. true NA for the variable. In fact, if you later do really careful EDA on the full data set with all variables, you will see this problem likely exists in this dataset\nAnyway, let’s correct all the NA for garage_qual to “no_garage” using mutate()\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(garage_qual = fct_expand(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"),\n2         garage_qual = replace_na(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"))\n\n\n1\n\nFirst add a new level to the factor\n\n2\n\nThen recode NA to that new level\n\n\n\n\nWe will leave the NA for garage_cars as NA because its not clear if that is truly missing or not, based on further EDA not shown here.\n\nWe have one other issue with garage_qual. It is an ordinal variable but we never reviewed the order of its levels. The data dictionary indicates the levels are ordered (best to worst) as:\n\nEx (excellent)\nGd (good)\nTA (typical/average)\nFa (fair)\nPo (poor)\n\nAnd we might assume that no garage is even worse than a poor garage.

    "text": "2.5 Working with Recipes\nRecipes are used for feature engineering in tidymodels using the recipes package\n\nUsed for transforming raw predictors into features used in our models\nDescribes all steps to make feature matrix. For example:\n\nTransforming factors into “dummy” features if needed\nLinear and non-linear transformations (e.g., log, box-cox)\nPolynomials and interactions (i.e., x1 * x1 or x1 * x2)\nMissing value imputations\n\nProper use of recipes is an important tool to prevent data leakage between train and either validation or test.\nRecipes use only information from the training set in all feature engineering\nConsider example of standardizing x1 for a feature in train vs. validation and test. Must use mean and sd from TRAIN to standardize x1 in train, validate, and test. VERY IMPORTANT.\n\nWe use recipes in a two step process - prep() and bake()\n\n“Prepping” a recipe involves calculating any statistics needed for the transformations that will be applied to engineer features (e.g., mean and standard deviation to normalize a numeric variable).\n\nPrepping is done with the prep() function.\nPrepping is always done only with training data. A “prepped” recipe does not derive any statistics from validation or test sets.\n\n“Baking” is the process of calculating the features\n\nBaking is done with the bake() function.\nWe used our prepped recipe when we bake.\nWhereas we only prep a recipe with training data, we can use a prepped recipe to bake features from any dataset (training, validation, or test).\n\n\nWe will work with recipes extensively when model building starting in unit 3\nFor now, we will only use the recipe to indicate roles as a gentle introduction.\nWe will expand on this recipe in unit 3\nRecipe syntax is very similar to generic tidyverse syntax (created by same group)\n\nActually a subset of tidyverse functions\nLess flexible/powerful but focused on our needs and easier to learn\nYou will eventually know both\n\n\nRecipes are used in Modeling scripts (which is a third type of script after cleaning and modeling EDA scripts)\n\nLets reload training again to pretend we are starting a new script\n\n\n data_trn &lt;- read_csv(file.path(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"), \n                      col_types = cols()) |&gt; \n1  class_ames() |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nRemember our function for classing!\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n\n\n\nRecipes can be used to indicate the outcome and predictors that will be used in the model\n\nCan use . to indicate all predictors\n\nCurrently, our preferred method with some exceptions\nWe can exclude some predictors later by changing their role, removing them with a later recipe step (\\(step\\_rm()\\)), or specifying a more precise formula when we fit the model\nSee Roles in Recipes for more info\n\nCan use specific names of predictors along with \\(+\\) if only a few predictors\n\ne.g., sale_price ~ lot_area + year_built + overall_qual\n\nDo NOT indicate interactions here\n\nAll predictors are combined with +\nInteractions are specified by a later explicit feature engineering step\n\n\n\nrec &lt;- recipe(sale_price ~ ., data = data_trn)\n\nrec\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 9\n\nsummary(rec)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   variable     type      role      source  \n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;list&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 gr_liv_area  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 2 lot_area     &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 3 year_built   &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 4 overall_qual &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 5 garage_cars  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 6 garage_qual  &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 7 ms_zoning    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 8 lot_config   &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 9 bldg_type    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n10 sale_price   &lt;chr [2]&gt; outcome   original\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Prepping and Baking a Recipe\nLet’s make a feature matrix from the training set\nThere are two discrete (and important) steps * prep() * bake()\nFirst we prep the recipe using the training data\n\n1rec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt;\n2  prep(training = data_trn)\n\n\n1\n\nWe start by prepping our raw/original recipe (rec)\n\n2\n\nWe use the prep() function on on the training data.

    "text": "3.2 The Simple (General) Linear Model (LM)\nWe will start with a review of the use of the simple (one feature) linear model (LM) as a machine learning model because you should be very familiar with this statistical model at this point\n\\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\epsilon\\)\nApplied to our regression problem, we might fit a model such as:\n\\(sale\\_price = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*gr\\_liv\\_area + \\epsilon\\)\nThe GLM is a parametric model. We need to estimate two parameters, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), using our training dataset.\nYou already know how to do this using lm() in base R. However, we will use the tidymodels modeling approach.\n\nWe use tidymodels because:\n\nIt provides a consistent interface to many (and growing numbers) of statistical algorithms\nIt provides very strong and easy feature engineering routines (e.g., missing data, scaling, transformations, near-zero variance, collinearity)\nIt simplifies model performance evaluation using resampling approaches (that you don’t know yet!)\nIt supports numerous performance metrics\nIt is (mostly) tightly integrated within the tidyverse\nIt is under active development and support\nYou can see documentation for all of the packages at the tidymodels website. It is worth a quick review now to get a sense of what is available\n\n\nTo fit a model with a specific configuration, we need to:\n\nSet up a feature engineering recipe\nUse the recipe to make a feature matrix\n\nprep() it with training data\nbake() it with data you want to use to calculate feature matrix\n\nSelect and define the statistical algorithm\nFit the algorithm in the feature matrix\n\nThese steps are accomplished with functions from the recipes and parsnip packages.\nWe will start with a simple model configuration\n\nGeneral linear model\nOne feature (raw gr_liv_area)\nFit in training data\n\n\nSet up a VERY SIMPLE feature engineering recipe\n\nInclude outcome on the left size of ~\nInclude raw predictors (not yet features) on the right side of ~.\n\nIndicate the training data\n\n\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(sale_price ~ gr_liv_area, data = data_trn)\n\n\nWe can see a summary of it to verify it is doing what you expect\n\n\nsummary(rec)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  variable    type      role      source  \n  &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "3.4 Extension to Categorical Predictors\nMany important predictors in our models may be categorical (ordered and unordered)\n\nSome statistical algorithms (e.g., random forest) can accept even unordered categorical predictors as features without any further feature engineering\nBut many cannot. Linear models cannot.\nThe type of feature engineering may differ for unordered vs. ordered categorical predictors\nFor unordered categorical predictors:\n\nWe need to learn a common approach to transform them to numeric features - dummy coding. We will learn the concept in general AND how to accomplish within a feature engineering recipe.\n\nFor ordered categorical predictors:\n\nWe can treat them like numeric predictors\nWe can treat them like unordered categorical predictors\n\nSee article on Categorical Predictors on the tidymodels website for more details\n\n\n3.4.1 Dummy Coding\nFor many algorithms, we will need to use feature engineering to convert a categorical predictor to numeric features. One common technique is to use dummy coding. When dummy coding a predictor, we transform the original categorical predictor with m levels into m-1 dummy coded features.\nTo better understand how and why we do this, lets consider a version of ms_zoning in the Ames dataset.\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; \n  table()\n\n\n    agri   commer    float    indus res_high  res_low  res_med \n       2       13       66        1        9     1157      217 \n\n\nWe will recode ms_zoning to have only 3 levels to make our example simple (though dummy codes can be used for predictors with any number of levels)\n\ndata_dummy &lt;- data_trn |&gt; \n1  select(sale_price, ms_zoning)  |&gt;\n2  mutate(ms_zoning3 = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\", \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n3                                 \"floating\" = \"float\")) |&gt;\n4  select(-ms_zoning)\n\n\n1\n\nMake a df (dataframe) with only sale_price and ms_zoning\n\n2\n\nfct_collapse() from the forcats package is our preferred way to collapse levels of a factor. See fct_recode() for more generic recoding of levels.\n\n3\n\nWe could have left this line out and float would have stayed as a level named float\n\n4\n\nRemove original ms_zoning predictor\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the new predictor\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  pull(ms_zoning3) |&gt; \n  table() \n\n\n commercial    floating residential \n         16          66        1383 \n\n\n\nWe need to convert this three-level, unordered categorical predictor (currently classed as a factor) to numeric features to allow us to use it in statistical algorithms like the general linear model.\n[Why can’t we simply recode each level with a different consecutive value (e.g., commercial = 1, floating =2 , residential = 3)?].{red} 3\n\nImagine fitting a straight line to predict sale_price from ms_zoning3 using these three different ways to arbitrarily assign numbers to levels.\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 3,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 2)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\nDummy coding resolves this issue.\n\nWhen using dummy codes, we transform (i.e., feature engineer) our original m-level categorical predictor to m-1 dummy features.\n\nEach of these m-1 features represents a contrast between a specific level of the categorical variable and a reference level\nThe full set of m-1 features represents the overall effect of the categorical predictor variable.\nWe assign values of 0 or 1 to each observation on each feature in a meaningful pattern (see below)\n\n\nFor example, with our three-level predictor: ms_zoning3\n\nWe need 2 features (f1, f2) to represent this 3-level categorical predictor\nFeature 1 is coded 1 for residential and 0 for all other levels\nFeature 2 is coded 1 for floating and 0 for all other levels\n\nHere is this coding scheme displayed in a table\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  ms_zoning3     f1    f2\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 commercial      0     0\n2 residential     1     0\n3 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nWith this coding:\n\nCommercial properties are coded 0 for both f1 and f2.\n\nThis means that commercial properties will become the reference level against which both residential and floating village are compared.\nBecause we are focused on prediction, the choice of reference level is mostly arbitrary. For explanatory goals, you might consider which level is best suited to be the reference.\n3.5 There is much deeper coverage of dummy and other contrast coding in 610/710\n\nWe can add these two features manually to the data frame and view a handful of observations to make this coding scheme more concrete\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  sale_price ms_zoning3     f1    f2\n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     105000 residential     1     0\n2     126000 residential     1     0\n3      13100 commercial      0     0\n4     115000 residential     1     0\n5     149500 floating        0     1\n6      40000 commercial      0     0\n7     120000 residential     1     0\n8     151000 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nIf we now fit a model where we predict sale_price from these two dummy coded features, each feature would represent the contrast of the mean sale_price for the level coded 1 vs. the mean sale_price for the level that is coded 0 for all features (i.e., commercial)\n\nf1 is the contrast of mean sale_price for residential vs. commercial\nf2 is the contrast of mean sale_price for floating vs. commercial\nThe combined effect of these two features represents the overall effect of ms_zoning3 on sale_price\n\n\nLets do this quickly in base r using lm() as you have done previously in 610.\n\nm &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ f1 + f2, data = data_dummy) \n\nm |&gt; summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ f1 + f2, data = data_dummy)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-166952  -50241  -20241   31254  565259 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This would also prevent a linear model from fitting (‘dummy variable trap’).\nHowever, some statistical algorithms do not have problems with perfect multicollinearity (e.g., LASSO, ridge regression).\n\nFor these algorithms, you will sometimes see modified version of dummy coding called one-hot coding.\n\nThis approach uses one additional dummy coded feature for the final category.\n\nWe won’t spend time on this but you should be familiar with the term b/c it is often confused with dummy coding.\n\n\n\nCoding Sidebar\nWhen creating dummy coded features from factors that have levels with infrequent observations, you may occasionally end up with novel levels in your validation or test sets that were not present in your training set.\n\nThis will cause you issues.\n\nThese issues are mostly resolved if you make sure to explicitly list all possible levels for a factor when classing that factor in the training data, even if the level doesn’t exist in the training data.\n\nWe provide more detail on this issue in an appendix.\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Unordered Categorical Predictors\nNow that we understand how to use dummy coding to feature engineer unordered categorical predictors, let’s consider some potentially important ones that are available to us.

They also all tend to have the lower prices.\nCombine all the residential to get a better feature to variance accounted ratio. They all tend to have similar prices on average and res_high is also pretty low n. \n\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"ms_zoning\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nlot_config\n\nMost are inside lots, some of the lot categories are low n\nMedian sale_price is not very different between configurations\nNot very promising but could help some (particularly given the large sample size)\n\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"lot_config\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary entry: Lot configuration\n\ninside: Inside lot\ncorner: Corner lot\nculdsac: Cul-de-sac\nfr2: Frontage on 2 sides of property\nfr3: Frontage on 3 sides of property\n\n\nbldg_type\n\nMost of the houses are in one category - one_fam\nThere is not much difference in median sale_price among categories\nNot very promising\n\n\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"bldg_type\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary entry: Type of dwelling\n\none_fam: Single-family Detached\n\ntwo_fam: Two-family Conversion; originally built as one-family dwelling\nduplex: Duplex\ntown_end: Townhouse End Unit\ntown_inside: Townhouse Inside Unit\n\n\nLet’s do some feature engineering with ms_zoning. We can now do this formally in a recipe so that it can be used in our modeling workflow.\nFirst, if you noticed earlier, there are some levels for ms_zoning that are pretty infrequent. Lets make sure both data_trn and data_val have all levels set for this factor.\n\ndata_trn |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"agri\"     \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\ndata_val |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\n\nAs expected, we are missing a level (agri) in data_val. Lets fix that.\n\ndata_val &lt;- data_val |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning = factor(ms_zoning, \n                            levels = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"float\", \"indus\", \"res_high\", \"res_low\", \"res_med\")))\n\n\nWith that fixed, let’s proceed:\n\nWe will collapse categories down to three levels (commercial, residential, floating village) as before but now using step_mutate() combined with fct_collapse() to do this inside of our recipe.\n\nWe will convert to dummy features using step_dummy(). The first level of the factor will be set to the reference level when we call step_dummy().\nstep_dummy() is a poor choice for function name. It actually uses whatever contrast coding we have set up in R. However, the default is are dummy coded contrasts (R calls this treatment contrasts).

40, rnorm(150, 25, 10), rnorm(150, 75, 10))\\)\n\n\nWarning in geom_vline(xintercept = 90, color = \"red\", linewith = 1.5): Ignoring\nunknown parameters: `linewith`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.1 The hyperparameter k\nKNN is our first example of a statistical algorithm that includes a hyperparameter, in this case k\n\nAlgorithm hyperparameters differ from parameters in that they cannot be estimated while fitting the algorithm to the training set\nThey must be set in advance\nk = 5 is the default for kknn(), the engine from the kknn package that we will use to fit a KNN within tidymodels.\n\n\\(kknn()\\) weights observations (neighbors) based on distance.\n\nAn option exists for unweighted as well but not likely used much (default is optimal weighting, use it!).\n\n\n\nUsing the polynomial DGP above, let’s look at a 5-NN yields\n\nNote the new category of algorithm, new engine, and the need to set a mode (because KNN can be used for regression and classification)\nWe can look in the package documentation to better understand what is being done (?kknn::train.kknn).\n\n\nnearest_neighbor() |&gt;

We need to put all features on the same scale\n\nScale all features to SD = 1 (using step_scale(all_numeric_predictors()))\nRange correct [0, 1] all features (using step_range(all_numeric_predictors()))\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Categorical Predictors\nKNN requires numeric features (for distance calculation).\n\nFor categorical predictors, you will need to use dummy coding or other feature engineering that results in numeric features.\ne.g., step_dummy(all_factor_predictors())\n\n\n\n\n3.7.5 KNN with Ames Housing Prices\nLet’s use KNN with Ames\n\nTrain a model using only numeric predictors and overall_qual as numeric\nUse the default k = 5 algorithm\nrange correct all features\n\n\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(sale_price ~ gr_liv_area + lot_area + year_built + garage_cars + overall_qual, \n         data = data_trn) |&gt; \n  step_impute_median(garage_cars) |&gt; \n  step_mutate(overall_qual = as.numeric(overall_qual)) |&gt; \n1  step_scale(all_numeric_predictors())\n\nrec\n\n\n1\n\nRemember to take advantage of these selectors for easier code!

    "text": "These models will all overfit the dataset within which they are fit to some degree (in other words, they will predict both systematic variance and some noise in the training set). However, they will differ in how much they overfit the training set. As the models get more flexible they will have the potential to overfit to a greater degree. Models with a larger number of features (e.g., more predictors, features based on interactions as well as raw predictors) will overfit to a greater degree. All other things equal, the non-parametric KNN will also be more flexible than the general linear model so it may overfit to a greater degree as well if the true DGP is linear on the features. Therefore, just because a model fits the training set well does not mean it will work well in new data because the noise will be different in every new dataset.↩︎\n“The multiple regression model coefficients represent unique effects, controlling for all other variables in the model. You can see how the unique effect of gr_liv_area is smaller than its overall effect from the simple regression. This also means that the overall predictive strength of the model won’t be a sum of the effects of each predictor considered in isolation - it will likely be less. Also, if the correlations are high, problems with multicollinearity will emerge. This will yield large standard errors which means that the models will start to have more variance when fit in different training datasets! We will soon learn about other regularized versions of the GLM that don’t have these issues with correlated predictors.↩︎\nThere is no meaningful way to order the numbers that we assign to the levels of this unordered categorical predictor. The shape and strength of the relationship between it and sale_price will completely change based on arbitrary ordering of the levels.↩︎\nAs you know, the estimation procedure in linear models is OLS. Parameter estimates are derived to minimize the SSE in the data set in which they are derived. For this reason, adding a predictor will never increase RMSE in the training set and it will usually lower it even when it is not part of the DGP. However, this is not true in validation. A predictor will only meaningfully lower RMSE in validation if it is part of the DGP. Also, a bad predictor could even increase RMSE in validation due to overfitting.↩︎\nFor x = 10, find the five observations that have X values closest to 10. Average the Y values for those 5 observations and that is your prediction (\\(\\hat{Y}\\)) associated with that new value of X. Repeat to make predictions for \\(\\hat{Y}\\) for any other value of X, e.g., 50, 90, or any other value↩︎\nSmaller values of k will tend to increase overfitting (and therefore variance across training samples) but decrease bias. Larger values of k will tend to decrease overfitting but increase bias. We need to find the Goldilocks “sweet spot”↩︎\nk = 1 will perfectly fit the training set. Therefore it is very dependent on the training set (high variance). It will fit both the DGP and the noise in the training set. Clearly it will likely not do as well in validation (it will be overfit to training). k needs to be larger if there is more noise (to average over more cases). k needs to be smaller if the relationships are complex. (More on choosing k by resampling in unit 5.↩︎"

BUT, there are still some complexities when we fit this model in train and predict into test. In training, the x_foo feature is a constant (all 0) so this will present some issues for some statistical algorithms. Lets see what happens when we fit a linear model and use it to predict into test.\n\nfit1 &lt;-\n  linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(y ~ ., data = feat_trn1)\n\nIf we look at the parameter estimates, we see that the algorithm was unable to estimate a parameter for x_foo because it was a constant in train\n\nfit1 %&gt;% tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   0.181      0.910    0.199    0.855\n2 x_b           0.0370     1.29     0.0288   0.979\n3 x_c          -0.123      1.29    -0.0959   0.930\n4 x_foo        NA         NA       NA       NA    \n\n\nThis will generate a warning (“prediction from a rank-deficient fit has doubtful cases”) when you use this model to make predictions for values it didnt see in the training set.\n\nThe consequence is that the model will predict a y value associated with the reference level (coded 0 for all other dummy features) for all foo observations. This is probably the best we can do for these new (previously unseen) values for x.\nalso note that the column name for predictions, which is usually called .pred, is now called .pred_res. You will need to accomodate this in your code as well. Just rename it.\n\n\npredict(fit1, feat_test1) |&gt;  \n  bind_cols(feat_test1)\n\nWarning in predict.lm(object = object$fit, newdata = new_data, type =\n\"response\"): prediction from rank-deficient fit; attr(*, \"non-estim\") has\ndoubtful cases\n\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 5\n  .pred_res       y   x_b   x_c x_foo\n      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    0.181   0.185      0     0     0\n2    0.219  -0.220      1     0     0\n3    0.0580 -1.61       0     1     0\n4    0.181   0.0362     0     0     0\n5    0.219   0.266      1     0     0\n6    0.0580  0.710      0     1     0\n7    0.181   0.637      0     0     1\n\n\nThis is our preferred solution when new/previously unseen values exist in held out data.
