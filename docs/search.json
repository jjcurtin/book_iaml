    "text": "2.3 Best Practices and Other Recommendations\n\n2.3.1 Data file formats\nWe generally store data as CSV [comma-separated value] files\n\nEasy to view directly in a text editor\nEasy to share because others can use/import into any data analysis platform\nWorks with version control (e.g. git, svn)\nuse read_csv() and write_csv()\n\nExceptions include:\n\nWe may consider binary (.rds) format for very big files because read/write can be slow for csv files.\n\nBinary file format provides a very modest additional protection for sensitive data (which we also don’t share)\nuse read_rds() and write_rds()\n\nSee chapter 7 - Data Import in Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) for more details and advanced techniques for importing data using read_csv()\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Classing Variables\nWe store and class variables in R based on their data type (level of measurement).\n\nSee Wikipedia definitions for levels of measurement for a bit more precision that we will provide here.\n\nCoarsely, there are four levels:\n\nnominal: qualitative categories, no inherent order (e.g., marital status, sex, car color)\nordinal: qualitative categories (sometimes uses number), inherent order but not equidistant spacing (e.g., Likert scale; education level)\ninterval and ratio (generally treated the same in social sciences): quantitative scores, ordered, equidistant spacing. Ratio has true 0. (e.g., temperature in Celsius vs. Kelvin scales)\n\nWe generally refer to nominal and ordinal variables as categorical and interval/ratio as quantitative or numeric\n\nFor nominal variables\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors when we load them (using read_csv())\nIn some cases, we should pay attention to the order of the levels of the variable. e.g.,\n\nFor a dichotomous outcome variable, the positive/event level of dichotomous factor outcome should be first level of the factor\nThe order of levels may also matter for factor predictors (e.g., step_dummy() uses first level as reference).\n\n\n\nFor ordinal variables:\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors (just like nominal variables)\n\nIt is easier to do EDA with these variables classes as factors\nWe use standard factors (not ordered)\n\nConfirm that the order of the levels is set up correctly. This is very important for ordinal variables.\nDuring feature engineering stage, we can then either\n\nTreat as a nominal variable and create features using step_dummy()\nTreat as an interval variable using step_ordinalscore()\n\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both nominal and ordinal variable\nOrdinal variables may show non-linear relations b/c they may not be evenly spaced. In these instances, we can use feature engineering approaches that are also used for nominal variables\n\nFor interval and ratio variables:\n\nWe store these variables as numeric\nWe class these variables as numeric (either integer or double - let R decide) during the read and clean stage (They are typically already in this class when read in)\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both interval and ratio variables\nSimilar feature engineering approaches are used with both\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Data Dictionaries\nYou should always make a data dictionary for use with your data files.\n\nIdeally, these are created during the planning phase of your study, prior to the start of data collection\nStill useful if created at the start of data analysis\n\nData dictionaries:\n\nhelp you keep track of your variables and their characteristics (e.g., valid ranges, valid responses)\ncan be used by you to check your data during EDA\ncan be provided to others when you share your data (data are not generally useful to others without a data dictionary)\n\nWe will see a variety of data dictionaries throughout the course. Many are not great as you will learn.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 The Ames Housing Prices Dataset\nWe will use the Ames Housing Prices dataset as a running example this unit (and some future units and application assignments as well)\n\nYou can read more about the original dataset created by Dean DeCock\nThe data set contains data from home sales of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010\nThe original data set includes 2930 observations of sales price and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous)\nThis is the original data dictionary\nThe challenge with this dataset is to build the best possible prediction model for the sale price of the homes.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Packages and Conflicts\nFirst, lets set up our environment with functions from important packages. I strongly recommend reviewing our recommendations for best practices regarding managing function conflicts now. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future.\n\nWe set a conflicts policy that will produce errors if we have unanticipated conflicts.\nWe source a library of functions that we use for common tasks in machine learning.\n\nThis includes a function (tidymodels_conflictRules()) that sets conflict rules to allow us to attach tidymodels functions without conflicts with tidyverse functions.\n\nYou can review that function to see what it does (search for that function name at the link)\n\nThen we use that function\n\n\noptions(conflicts.policy = \"depends.ok\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true\")\ntidymodels_conflictRules()\n\n\nNext we load packages for functions that we will use regularly. There are five things to note RE best practices\n\nIf we will use a lot of functions from a package (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels), we attach the full package\nIf we will use only several functions from a package (but plan to use them repeatedly), we use the include.only parameter to just attach those functions.\nAt times, if we plan to use a single function from a package only 1-2x times, we may not even attach that function at all. Instead, we just call it using its namespace (i.e. packagename::functionname)\nIf a package has a function that conflicts with our primary packages and we don’t plan to use that function, we load the package but exclude the function. If we really needed it, we can call it with its namespace as per option 3 above.\nPay attention to conflicts that were allowed to make sure you understand and accept them. (I left the package messages and warnings in the book this time to see them. I will hide them to avoid cluttering book in later units but you should always review them.)\n\n\n1library(janitor, include.only = \"clean_names\")\n2library(cowplot, include.only = \"plot_grid\")\n3library(kableExtra, exclude = \"group_rows\")\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n4library(tidymodels)\n\n\n1\n\nAs an alternative, we could have skipped loading the package and instead called the function as janitor::clean_names()\n\n2\n\nSame is true for cowplot package\n\n3\n\nWhen loading kableExtra (which we use often), you will always need to exclude groups_rows() to prevent a conflict with dplyr package in the tidyverse\n\n4\n\nLoading tidymodels will produce conflicts unless you source and call my function tidymodels_conflictRules() (see above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Source and Other Environment Settings\nWe will also source (from github) two other libraries of functions that we use commonly for exploratory data analyses. You should review these function scripts (fun_eda.R; fun_plots.R to see the code for these functions.\n\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true\")\n\n\nFinally, we tune our environment a bit more by setting plot themes and print options that we prefer\n\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\noptions(tibble.width = Inf, tibble.print_max = Inf)\n\nAnd we set a relative path to our data. This assumes you are using an RStudio project with the path to the data relative to that project file. I’ve provided more detail elsewhere on best practices for managing files and paths.\n\npath_data &lt;- \"data\"\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Read and Glimpse Dataframe\nLets read in the data and glimpse the subset of observations we will work with in Units 2-3 and the first two application assignments.\nNote that we re-class all character variables as factors\n\n1data_all &lt;- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_raw_class.csv\"),\n2                     col_types = cols()) |&gt;\n3  mutate(across(where(is.character), factor)) |&gt;\n4  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nFirst we read data using a relative path and the here::here() function. This is a replacement for file.path() that works better for both interactive use and rendering in Quarto when using projects.\n\n2\n\nWe use col_types = cols() to let R guess the correct class for each column. This suppresses messages that aren’t important at this point prior to EDA.\n\n3\n\nThen we use a mutate to re-class all character data to factors. This should handle most of our nominal and ordinal variables. We may need to still class some that were missed because they appeared to be numeric. I prefer factor() to forcats::fct() because factor orders the levels alphabetically. Be aware that this could change if your code is used in a region of the world where this sorting is different. I still prefer this to the alternative (in fct()) that orders by the order the levels are found in your data.\n\n4\n\nIt is good practice to always glimpse() data after you read it.\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 81\n$ PID               &lt;fct&gt;

    "text": "2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Cleaning\nEDA could be done using either tidyverse packages and functions or tidymodels (mostly using the recipes package.)\n\nWe prefer to use the richer set of functions available in the tidyverse (and dplyr and purrr packages in particular).\nWe will reserve the use of recipes for feature engineering only when we are building features for models that we will fit in our training sets and evaluation in our validation and test sets.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Data Leakage Issues\nData leakage refers to a mistake made by the developer of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between their training set and held-out validation or test sets\n\nTraining sets are used to fit models with different configurations\nValidation sets are used to select the best model among those with different configurations (not needed if you only have one configuration)\nTest sets are used to evaluate a best model\nWhen splitting data-sets into training, validation and test sets, the goal is to ensure that no data (or information more broadly) are shared between the three sets\n\nNo data or information from test should influence either fitting or selecting models\nTest should only be used once to evaluate a best/final model\nTrain and validation set also must be segregated (although validation sets may be used to evaluate many model configurations)\nInformation necessary for transformations and other feature engineering (e.g., means/sds for centering/scaling, procedures for missing data imputation) must all be based only on training data.\nData leakage is common if you are not careful.\n\n\nIn particular, if we begin to use test data or information about test during model fitting\n\nWe risk overfitting\nThis is essentially the equivalent of p-hacking in traditional analyses\nOur estimate of model performance will be too optimistic, which could have harmful real-world consequences.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Tidy variable names\nUse snake case for variable names\n\nclean_names() from janitor package is useful for this.\nMay need to do further correction of variable names using rename()\nSee more details about tidy names for objects (e.g., variables, dfs, functions) per Tidy Style Guide\n\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  clean_names(\"snake\")\n\ndata_all |&gt; names()\n\n [1] \"sale_price\"   \"gr_liv_area\"  \"lot_area\"     \"year_built\"   \"overall_qual\"\n [6] \"garage_cars\"  \"garage_qual\"  \"ms_zoning\"    \"lot_config\"   \"bldg_type\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Explore variable classes\nAt this point, variables should be classed as either numeric or factor\n\nInterval and ratio variables use numeric classes (dbl or int)\nNominal and ordinal variable use factor class\nUseful for variable selection later (e.g., where(is.numeric), where(is.factor))\n\nSubsequent cleaning steps are clearer if we have this established/confirmed now\n\nWe have one variable to change to factor class\n\ndata_all |&gt; glimpse()\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, T…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; RL, RH, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, R…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; Corner, Inside, Corner, Inside, Inside, Inside, Inside, I…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, 1Fam, 1Fa…\n\n\noverall_qual is ordinal\n\nread_csv() thought was numeric by the levels are coded using numbers\nWe should convert it to a factor and confirm the levels are ordered properly.\n\nThe data dictionary indicates that valid values range from 1 - 10.\n\n\nHere is the code to re-class it\n\n1oq_levels &lt;- 1:10\n\nt &lt;-  data_all |&gt; \n  mutate(overall_qual = factor(overall_qual, \n2                               levels = oq_levels)) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nIt is always best to explicitly set the levels of an ordinal factor in the order you prefer.

dictionary, we see that NA for garage_qual should be coded as “no garage”. We will correct this in our data set.\nThis is a pretty poor choice on the part of the researchers who created the dataset because it becomes impossible to distinguish between NA that means no garage vs. true NA for the variable. In fact, if you later do really careful EDA on the full data set with all variables, you will see this problem likely exists in this dataset\nAnyway, let’s correct all the NA for garage_qual to “no_garage” using mutate()\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(garage_qual = fct_expand(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"),\n2         garage_qual = replace_na(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"))\n\n\n1\n\nFirst add a new level to the factor\n\n2\n\nThen recode NA to that new level\n\n\n\n\nWe will leave the NA for garage_cars as NA because its not clear if that is truly missing or not, based on further EDA not shown here.\n\nWe have one other issue with garage_qual. It is an ordinal variable but we never reviewed the order of its levels. The data dictionary indicates the levels are ordered (best to worst) as:\n\nEx (excellent)\nGd (good)\nTA (typical/average)\nFa (fair)\nPo (poor)\n\nAnd we might assume that no garage is even worse than a poor garage.

We often use anonymous functions when using the functions from the purrr package (e.g., map(), walk())\nWe use walk() from the purrr package to apply our anonymous function to all columns of the data frame at once\nJust copy this code for now\nWe will see simpler uses later that will help you understand iteration with purrr functions\nSee the chapter on iteration in R for Data Science (2e) for more info on map() and walk()\n\n\n\n\n2.4.8 Tidy Responses for Categorical Variables\nFeature engineering with nominal and ordinal variables typically involves\n\nConverting to factors\nOften creating dummy features from these factors\n\nThis feature engineering will use response labels for naming new features\n\nTherefore, it is a good idea to have the responses snake-cased and cleaned up a bit so that these new feature names are clean/clear.\n\nHere is an easy way to convert responses for character variables to snake case using a function (tidy_responses()) we share in fun_eda.R (reproduced here).\n\nThis uses regular expressions (regex), which will will learn about in a later unit on text processing.\nYou could expand this cleaning function if you encounter other issues that need to be cleaned in the factor levels.\n\n\ntidy_responses &lt;- function(column){\n  # replace all non-alphanumeric with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\W\", \"_\"))\n  # replace whitespace with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\s+\", \"_\"))\n  # replace multiple _ with single _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_+\", \"_\"))\n  #remove _ at end of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_$\", \"\"))\n  # remove _ at start of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\^_\", \"\"))\n  # convert to lowercase\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, tolower)\n  factor(column)\n}\n\n\nLet’s use the function\n\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(across(where(is.factor), tidy_responses)) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nWe use the tidy selection helper function to limit our mutate to only factors.

    "text": "2.6 Working with Recipes\nRecipes are used for feature engineering in tidymodels using the recipes package\n\nUsed for transforming raw predictors into features used in our models\nDescribes all steps to make feature matrix. For example:\n\nTransforming factors into “dummy” features if needed\nLinear and non-linear transformations (e.g., log, box-cox)\nPolynomials and interactions (i.e., x1 * x1 or x1 * x2)\nMissing value imputations\n\nProper use of recipes is an important tool to prevent data leakage between train and either validation or test.\nRecipes use only information from the training set in all feature engineering\nConsider example of standardizing x1 for a feature in train vs. validation and test. Must use mean and sd from TRAIN to standardize x1 in train, validate, and test. VERY IMPORTANT.\n\nWe use recipes in a two step process - prep() and bake()\n\n“Prepping” a recipe involves calculating any statistics needed for the transformations that will be applied to engineer features (e.g., mean and standard deviation to normalize a numeric variable).\n\nPrepping is done with the prep() function.\nPrepping is always done only with training data. A “prepped” recipe does not derive any statistics from validation or test sets.\n\n“Baking” is the process of calculating the features\n\nBaking is done with the bake() function.\nWe used our prepped recipe when we bake.\nWhereas we only prep a recipe with training data, we can use a prepped recipe to bake features from any dataset (training, validation, or test).\n\n\n\nWe will work with recipes extensively when model building starting in unit 3\nFor now, we will only use the recipe to indicate roles as a gentle introduction.\nWe will expand on this recipe in unit 3\nRecipe syntax is very similar to generic tidyverse syntax (created by same group)\n\nActually a subset of tidyverse functions\nLess flexible/powerful but focused on our needs and easier to learn\nYou will eventually know both\n\n\nRecipes are used in Modeling scripts (which is a third type of script after cleaning and modeling EDA scripts)\n\nLets reload training again to pretend we are starting a new script\n\n\n data_trn &lt;- read_csv(file.path(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"), \n                      col_types = cols()) |&gt; \n1  class_ames() |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n1\n\nRemember our function for classing!\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n\n\n\nRecipes can be used to indicate the outcome and predictors that will be used in the model\n\nCan use . to indicate all predictors\n\nCurrently, our preferred method with some exceptions\nWe can exclude some predictors later by changing their role, removing them with a later recipe step (\\(step\\_rm()\\)), or specifying a more precise formula when we fit the model\nSee Roles in Recipes for more info\n\nCan use specific names of predictors along with \\(+\\) if only a few predictors\n\ne.g., sale_price ~ lot_area + year_built + overall_qual\n\nDo NOT indicate interactions here\n\nAll predictors are combined with +\nInteractions are specified by a later explicit feature engineering step\n\n\n\nrec &lt;- recipe(sale_price ~ ., data = data_trn)\n\nrec\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 9\n\nsummary(rec)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   variable     type      role      source  \n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;list&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 gr_liv_area  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 2 lot_area     &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 3 year_built   &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 4 overall_qual &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 5 garage_cars  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 6 garage_qual  &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 7 ms_zoning    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 8 lot_config   &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 9 bldg_type    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n10 sale_price   &lt;chr [2]&gt; outcome   original\n\n\n\n\n2.6.1 Prepping and Baking a Recipe\nLet’s make a feature matrix from the training set\nThere are two discrete (and important) steps - prep() - bake()\nFirst we prep the recipe using the training data\n\n1rec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt;\n2  prep(training = data_trn)\n\n\n1\n\nWe start by prepping our raw/original recipe (rec)\n\n2\n\nWe use the prep() function on on the training data.
