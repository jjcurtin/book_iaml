# Test


## Standards

### For displaying figures:

![](figs/unit1_data_dgp.png){width=100% fig-align="center"}

### For displaying code and even variable names

`demo <- function(x)`
`variable_2`


### For code annotation

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

d <- tibble (x = 1:5) |> # <1>
  glimpse() # <2>
```
1. make a df
2. glimpse a df



### For displaying color (like red questions)

[this sentence is in red]{.red}

This is an alternative method but more complex: I <span style="color:red;">love</span> R.


[red]{.red} [yellow]{.yellow} [green]{.green} [blue]{.blue}

[yellow background]{.yellowb} for better contrast



### Callouts for questions

HTML:

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
## This is the question you want displayed?

Here's the answer! This can be as long as you want.

:::

RevealJS does not yet have callout collapse implemented. A workaround is to use code folding:


::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## If the DGP for y is a cubic function of x, what do we know about the expected bias for our three candidate model configurations in this example?
```{html}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Answer"
The simple linear model will underfit the true DGP and therefore it will be biased b/c 
it can only represent y as a linear function of x.  

The two polynomial models will be generally unbiased b/c they have x represented 
with 20th order polynomials.  

LASSO will be slightly biased due to regularization but more on that in a later unit
```

### Conditional Content

Use divs to specify content to only appear in certain formats:

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

Will only appear in HTML.

:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

Will only appear in revealJS
