# Ethical Issues in Machine Learning Research and Applications


## Overview of Unit

**Learning Objectives**

All semester, we have been learning how to develop and evaluate machine learning models. In this final unit, we will now consider the impact that these models have had to date on society.  Of course, there is the potential for many benefits from these models but they have also produced substantial harm.  It is important that we recognize what contributes to their harm so that we can strive to avoid these problems in our own work.


**Readings**

The readings this week will come from @WMD;  We will read the introduction, chapters 1, 3, 5, and the conclusion and afterword sections.


**Lecture Videos**
  
There are no lecture videos, or application assignment this week. The unit quiz will be free-response questions on the reading to help you prepare your thoughts to share during our discussion. It is due by 8 pm on Wednesday, May 1st.  We will meet on Tuesday for lab and Thursday for discussion.
