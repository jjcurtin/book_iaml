# Git and Shell Commands { .unnumbered}

This appendix provides a mini-tutorial on basic shell (command line) commands and Git. These skills are essential for this course because lab materials and course resources are available via a GitHub repository that you will need to clone and periodically pull updates from.

## Opening the Terminal

The **terminal** (also called the command line or shell) is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer.

**macOS:**

- Open Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and type "Terminal", then press Enter
- Or navigate to Applications > Utilities > Terminal

**Windows:**

- After installing Git (see [Installing Git for Windows] below), use **Git Bash**
- Search for "Git Bash" in the Start menu

## Essential Shell Commands

Below are the fundamental commands you will use to navigate your file system.

### `pwd` - Print Working Directory

Shows your current location in the file system.

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:
```
/Users/yourname
```

### `ls` - List Files

Lists files and folders in the current directory.

```bash
ls
```

To see more details (permissions, size, date modified):
```bash
ls -l
```

To see hidden files (files starting with `.`):
```bash
ls -a
```

### `cd` - Change Directory

Navigates to a different folder.

```bash
cd foldername
```

Useful shortcuts:

- `cd ~` - Go to your home directory
- `cd ..` - Go up one level (to the parent folder)
- `cd ../..` - Go up two levels
- `cd -` - Go back to the previous directory

Examples:
```bash
cd Documents          # Enter the Documents folder
cd ~/Desktop          # Go to Desktop from anywhere
cd ..                 # Go up one folder
```

### `mkdir` - Make Directory

Creates a new folder.

```bash
mkdir newfolder
```

To create nested folders at once:
```bash
mkdir -p Github/projects/iaml
```

### `mv` - Move or Rename

Moves a file or folder to a new location, or renames it.

```bash
mv oldname newname              # Rename a file
mv file.txt Documents/          # Move file to Documents folder
mv file.txt Documents/newname.txt  # Move and rename
```

## Setting Up Your GitHub Folder

We recommend creating a dedicated folder for all your GitHub repositories. This keeps your projects organized and makes navigation easier.

**Step 1:** Open your terminal

**Step 2:** Create a `Github` folder in your home directory:
```bash
mkdir ~/Github
```

**Step 3:** Navigate to this folder:
```bash
cd ~/Github
```

All repositories you clone should go inside this folder.

## Git Basics

**Git** is a version control system that tracks changes to files. **GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories online, allowing for sharing and collaboration.

For this course, you primarily need two Git commands:

### `git clone` - Clone a Repository

Downloads a repository from GitHub to your computer. You only need to do this **once** per repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name
```

This creates a folder with the repository name containing all the files.

### `git pull` - Pull Updates

Downloads the latest changes from GitHub. Use this to get updated materials after the initial clone.

```bash
git pull
```

**Important:** You must be inside the repository folder when running `git pull`.

## Example Workflow: Getting Course Materials

Here is the complete workflow for setting up and maintaining your course materials:

### Initial Setup (Do Once)

1. Open your terminal

2. Create your Github folder (if you haven't already):
```bash
mkdir ~/Github
```

3. Navigate to the Github folder:
```bash
cd ~/Github
```

4. Clone the course repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjcurtin/book_iaml
```

5. Verify the clone worked:
```bash
ls
```
You should see `book_iaml` listed.

### Getting Updates (Do Periodically)

When instructed to pull new materials:

1. Navigate to the repository:
```bash
cd ~/Github/book_iaml
```

2. Pull the latest changes:
```bash
git pull
```

You should see a summary of files that were updated, or "Already up to date" if there are no new changes.

## Always Pull Before Working
You should **always** pull before working within a repository, especially within a shared repository. This ensures you have the latest version of files and helps avoid merge conflicts.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `pwd` | Show current directory | `pwd` |
| `ls` | List files | `ls -l` |
| `cd` | Change directory | `cd ~/Github` |
| `mkdir` | Create folder | `mkdir newfolder` |
| `mv` | Move/rename | `mv old.txt new.txt` |
| `git clone` | Download repository | `git clone <url>` |
| `git pull` | Update repository | `git pull` |

## Installing Git for Windows

If you are using Windows, you need to install Git to access both Git commands and a Unix-like terminal (Git Bash).

### Download

1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
2. Select the appropriate installer:
   - **64-bit Git for Windows Setup** — Choose this for most Windows computers (Intel or AMD processors)
   - **ARM64 Git for Windows Setup** — Only choose this if you have a Surface Pro X or a device with a Qualcomm/Snapdragon processor

   If unsure, choose the 64-bit version.

### Installation

Run the downloaded installer. The default options work well for most users, and you can click "Next" through most screens. A few screens worth noting:

- **Default Editor:** I highly recommend using the Nano editor over Vim, especially if you are new to the CLI.
- **PATH Environment:** Select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" (this is the recommended default)
- **HTTPS Transport Backend:** Use the OpenSSL library. It's bundled with Git, and is simpler and more consistent for your likely use case.
- **Terminal Emulator:** Select "Use MinTTY" (the default)

For all other options, the defaults are fine. Click **Install** and wait for completion.

### Verify Installation

1. Open Git Bash (search for it in the Start menu)

2. Type the following command and press Enter:
```bash
git --version
```

You should see output like:
```
git version 2.43.0.windows.1
```

3. Test that shell commands work:
```bash
pwd
ls
```

### Using Git Bash

Git Bash provides a Unix-like terminal on Windows. All the shell commands covered in this appendix (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `mv`) work in Git Bash exactly as described.

**Tip:** You can right-click in any folder in Windows Explorer and select "Git Bash Here" to open a terminal already navigated to that folder.

## Troubleshooting

**"command not found: git"**

- On Windows: Make sure Git is installed and you're using Git Bash, not Command Prompt
- On macOS: Install Git via Xcode Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install`

**"fatal: not a git repository"**

- You're not inside a Git repository folder. Use `cd` to navigate into the cloned repository before running `git pull`.

**"Permission denied"**

- On macOS/Linux: You may need to add `sudo` before the command (you'll be prompted for your password)
- Make sure you have write permissions to the folder

**Clone fails with authentication error**

- For public repositories like the course materials, no authentication should be needed
- Ensure you're using the HTTPS URL (starts with `https://`)

## Learning More

If you're curious about learning more Unix/shell commands beyond the basics covered here, the Software Carpentry tutorial is an excellent resource:

The first 7 chapters cover essential skills like navigating files, working with files and directories, pipes and filters, and shell scripts.
