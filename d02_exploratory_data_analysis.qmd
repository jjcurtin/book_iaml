# IAML Unit 2: Dicussion

## Housekeeping

- Unit 2 solutions
  - Review in lab
  - Format of lab open for influence
- Course feedback for extra credit (to quiz score) starting on next quiz!
- Unit 3 homework
  - test set predictions
  - free lunch!
- An attempt at a reprex is generally expected now for code help.  Very important to learn!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quiz review and student questions

- Quiz review

- Student Questions
  - Great questions!
  - Write them down as you read and watch lectures
  - Use them to guide what topics we discuss
  - Bring them up during this discussion as we cover relevant topics
  - Not all questions will fit (Slack as an alternative for follow-up)
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
## More central topics

1. Review
    - Goal is to develop model that closely approximates DGP
    - Goal is to evaluate (estimate) how close our model is to the DGP (how much error) with as little error as possible
    - Bias, overfitting/variance for any estimate (model and performance of model)
    - candidate model configurations
    - fit, select, evaluate
    - training, validation, test (held-in; held-out)

\

2. Review: 2.2.1 Stages of Data Analysis and Model Development

\

3. Best practices (discuss quickly)
    - csv for data sharing, viewing, git (though be careful with data in github or other public repo!)
    - variable values saved as text when nominal and ordinal (self-documenting)
    - Create data dictionary - Documentation is critical!!
    - snake_case for variables and self-documenting names (systematic names too)
    - write function for classing data (done often)

\

4. Review: 2.3.1 Data Leakage Issues
    - Review section in webbook
    - Cleaning EDA is done with full dataset (but univariate).  Very limited (variable names, values, find errors)
    - Modeling EDA is only done with a training set (or even "eyeball" sample) - NEVER use validate or test set
    - Never estimate anything with full data set (e.g., missing values, standardize, etc) if you plan to evaluate the model
    - Use recipes, prep (all estimation) with held-in data then bake held-in (already in object) and the appropriate held-out set
    - Put test aside
    - You work with validation (for selecting best configuration) but never explore with validation (will still catch leakage with test but will be mislead to be overly optimistic and spoil test)

\

5. Review: 2.4.2 Prepping and Baking a Recipe
     - Review section in web book
     - Prep always with held in data, bake both held in (data alread in object) & held-out
     - Converts from matrix (df) of predictors to feature matrix
     - Feature engineering (transformations, combinations of predictors, dimensionality reduction)

\

6. Functions sidenote - fun_modeling.R on [github](https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support)
    - look at the functions.  Don't use them blackbox
    - make your own function script 

\

7. EDA for modeling
    - Limitless, just scratched the surface
    - Differs some based on dimensionality of dataset
    - Differs based on measurement of X and Y
    - Very important (and under-appreciated part) of science!
    - Learning about DGP
      - Understand univariate distributions, frequencies
      - Bivariate relationships
      - Interactions (3 or more variables)
      - Patterns in data


##  Extra topics, time permitting

8. Missing data
    - Exclude vs. Impute in training data.  Outcomes?
    - How to impute
    - Missing predictors in validate or test (can't exclude?). Exclude cases with missing outcomes.

\

9. Outliers
    - Drop or fix errors!
    - Goal is always to estimate DGP
    - Exclude
    - Retain
    - Bring to fence
    - Don't exclude/change outcome in validate/test

\

10. Issues with high dimensionality
    - Hard to do predictor level EDA
    - Common choices (normality transformations)
    - Observed vs. predicted plots
    - Methods for automated variable selection (glmnet)
   
\

11. Distributional Shape
    - Measurement issues (interval scale)
    - Implications for relationships with other variables
    - Solutions?

\

12. Linearity vs. More Complex Relationships
    - Transformations
    - Choice of statistical algorithm
    - Do you need a linear model?

\

13. Interactions
    - Domain expertise
    - Visual options for interactions
    - But what do you with high dimensional data?
    - Explanatory vs. prediction goals (algorithms that accommodate interactions)

\

14. How to handle all of these decisions in the machine learning framework
    - Goal is to develop a model that most closely approximates the DGP
    - How does validation and test help this?
    - Preregistration?
      - Pre-reg for performance metric, resampling method   
      - Use of resampling for other decisions
      - Use of resampling to find correct model to test explanatory goals

\

15. Model Assumptions
    - Why do we make assumptions?
      - Inference
      - Not needed for prediction (but?)
    - Flexibility wrt DGP
