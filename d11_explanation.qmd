# IAML Unit 11: Discussion

## Announcements

- Permutation test quiz question - full credit for all!
- Neural net winner

## Bayesian Model Comparison

- What is the difference between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches?
  - NHST does not provide the probabilities of the null and alternative hypotheses.
    - That is what we want
    - NHST gives us the probability of our data given the null
  - NHST focuses on a point-wise comparison (no difference) that is almost never true.
  - NHST yields no information about the null hypothesis (i.e., when we fail to reject)
  - The inference depends on the sampling and testing intention (think about Bonferonni correction)
  
- Role of feature ablation
- How to interpret [results](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_iaml/l11_explanation.html#bayesian-estimation-for-model-comparisons)
  - Credible intervals
  - Posterior probabilities for model comparisons
  - Use of ROPE

## PDP

- [How calculated and interpreted](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html)
- Problems?

## ALE

- [How calculated and interpreted](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ale.html)
- When to use?

## Feature Importance Approaches

Model specific vs. agnostic

## Permutation Feature Importance

- [How does it work](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_iaml/l11_explanation.html#permutation-feature-importance)
- What does it give you

## SHAP

- [How does it work](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html#general-idea)
- Local vs. global importance
- Individual vs. categories of features
- Useful plots
  - Global importance
  - Sina plots
  - SHAP dependence plots
  - Individual predictions

## Group discussion 

Get into small groups of 2-3. Think about one of the data sets we have worked with in class or your own! Create a research question you might ask using each of the following explanatory methods.

1. Bayesian model comparison
2. ALE or PDP plots
3. SHAP
