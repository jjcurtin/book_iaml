## Learning Objectives

All semester, we have been learning how to develop and evaluate machine learning models. In this final unit, we will now consider the impact that these models have had to date on society.  Of course, there is the potential for many benefits from these models but they have also produced substantial harm.  It is important that we recognize what contributes to their harm so that we can strive to avoid these problems in our own work.

There is no application assignment or videos
