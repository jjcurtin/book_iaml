# Test


## Standards

### For displaying figures:

![](figs/unit1_data_dgp.png){width=100% fig-align="center"}

### For displaying code and even variable names

`demo <- function(x)`
`variable_2`


### For sizing graphs and code-generated plots

* You can specify out-height or out-width as either pixels, inches, or percentages
* You can specify both using different units
* If you specify only one, the other should default to "auto" which keeps the figured scaled as in the original

```{r }
#| out-width: 3in
#| out-height: 100%

plot(pressure)
```



### For code annotation

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

d <- tibble (x = 1:5) |> # <1>
  glimpse() # <2>
```
1. make a df
2. glimpse a df



### For displaying color (like red questions)

[this sentence is in red]{.red}

This is an alternative method but more complex: I <span style="color:red;">love</span> R.


[red]{.red} [yellow]{.yellow} [green]{.green} [blue]{.blue}

[yellow background]{.yellowb} for better contrast



### Callouts for questions

::: {.callout-important"}
# This is the question you want displayed?
:::

::: {.fragment .uwred}
Here's the answer! This can be as long as you want and contain text, code, output etc
:::


### Conditional Content

Use divs to specify content to only appear in certain formats:

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

Will only appear in HTML.

:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

Will only appear in revealJS

### Links to qmd files as plaintext

Normally, a link to a qmd file functions as a link to the rendered html of that file. 
To link to a qmd file that is to be downloaded or viewed as raw text, you must link to the raw.github user content:

- cleaning EDA:  [qmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjcurtin/book_iaml/main/application_assignments/unit_02/hw_unit_02_cleaning.qmd) 
- modeling EDA: [qmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjcurtin/book_iaml/main/application_assignments/unit_02/hw_unit_02_modeling.qmd)
