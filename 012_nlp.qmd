# Natural Language Processing: Text Processing and Feature Engineering


## Overview of Unit

**Learning Objectives**

* Objective 1
* Objective 2


**Readings**

* @SMLTAR [Chapter 2: Tokenization](https://smltar.com/tokenization.html)
* @SMLTAR [Chapter 5: Word Embeddings](https://smltar.com/embeddings.html)

NOTES: Please read the above chapters more with an eye toward concepts and issues 
rather than code.  I will demonstrate a minimum set of functions to accomplish
the NLP modeling tasks for this unit.

Also know that the entire @SMLTAR [book] is really mandatory reading.  I would also 
strongly recommend this entire @TMR [book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).  Both 
will be important references at a minimum.
