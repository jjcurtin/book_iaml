## Comparisons across algorithms

Logistic regression models DGP condition probabilities using logistic function

- Get parameter estimates for effects of X 
- Makes strong assumptions about shape of DGP - linear on log-odds(Y)
- Yields linear decision boundary
- Better for binary outcomes but can do more than two levels (with some effort)
  - (**Briefly describe: multiple one vs other classes models approach**)
- Needs numeric features but can dummy code categorical variables (as with lm)
- Problems when classes are fully separable (or even mostly separable)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LDA uses Bayes theorem to estimate condition probability

- LDA models the distributions of the Xs separately for each class
- Then uses Bayes theorem to estimate $Pr(Y = k | X)$ for each k and assigns the  observation to the class with the highest probability

$Pr(Y = k|X) = \frac{\pi_k * f_k(X)}{\sum_{l = 1}^{K} f_l(X)}$

where

- $\pi_k$ is the prior probability that an observation comes from class k (estimated from frequencies of k in training)
- $f_k(X)$ is the density function of X for an observation from class k
  -  $f_k(X)$ is large if there is a high probability that an observation in class k has that set of values for X and small if that probability is low
  - $f_k(X)$ is difficult to estimate unless we make some simplifying assumptions
  - X is multivariate normal
  - Common covariance matrix ($\sum$) across K classesj
  - With these assumptions, we can estimate $\pi_k$, $\mu_k$, and $\sigma^2$ from the training set and calculate $Pr(Y = k|X)$ for each k
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Parametric model but parameters not useful for interpretation of effects of X
- Linear decision boundary  
- Assumptions about multivariate normal X and common $\sum$
- Dummy features may not work well given assumption about normally distributed?
- May require smaller sample sizes to fit than logistic regression if assumptions met
- Can natively handle more than two level for outcome  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
QDA relaxes one restrictive assumption of LDA
  
- Still required multivariate normal X
- **But it allows each class to have its own $\sum$**
- This makes it:
  - More flexible
  - Able to model non-linear decision boundaries including 2-way interactions (see formula for discriminant in @ISL)
  - How handle interactions by relaxing common $\sum$? 
  - But requires substantial increase in parameter estimation (more potential to overfit)
- Still problems with dummy features (not normal; product terms?)
- Can natively handle more than 2 levels of outcome like LDA
- Compare to LDA and Logistic Regression on bias-variance trade off?

RDA may be better than both LDA and QDA?  More on idea of blending after elastic net

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNN works similar to regression

- But now looks at percentage of observations for each class among nearest neighbors to estimate conditional probabilities
- Doesn't make assumptions about Xs or $\sum$ for LDA and/or QDA
- Not limited to linear decision boundaries like logistic and LDA
- Very flexible - low bias but high variance?
- K can be adjusted to impact bias-variance trade-off
- KNN can handle more than two level outcomes natively
- KNN can be computationally cost with big N (and many X)
  - Can down-sample training data to reduce this problem

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

- Both logistic and LDA are linear functions of X and therefore produce linear decision boundaries

- LDA makes additional assumptions about X (multivariate normal and common $\sum$) beyond logistic regression.  Relative performance is based on the quality of this assumption

- QDA relaxes the LDA assumption about common $\sum$ (and RDA can relax it partially)
  - This also allows for nonlinear decision boundaries including 2-way interactions among features
  - QDA is therefore more flexible, which means possibly less bias but more potential for overfitting

- Both QDA and LDA assume multivariate normal X so *may* not accommodate categorical predictors very well.  Logistic and KNN do accommodate categorical predictors

- KNN is non-parametric and therefore the most flexible
  - Can also handle interactions and non-linear effects natively (with feature engineering)
  - Increased overfitting, decreased bias?
  - Not very interpretable.  But LDA/QDA, although parametric, aren't as interpretable as logistic regression

- Logistic regression fails when classes are perfectly separated (but does that ever happen?) and is less stable when classes are well separated

- LDA, KNN, and QDA naturally accommodate more than two classes  
  - Logistic requires additional tweak
  
- Sample size issues
  - Logistic regression requires relatively large sample sizes.  
  - LDA may perform better than logistic regression with smaller sample sizes if assumptions are met (**QDA?**)
  - KNN can be computationally very costly with large sample sizes (and large number of X) but could always downsample training set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interactions in LDA and QDA

- Simulate multivariate normal distribution for X (`x1` and `x2`) using MASS package
- Separately for trn and val
- NOTE: I first did this with uniform distributions on X and the models fit more poorly.  Why?
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(discrim, exclude = "smoothness")
set.seed(5433)
means <- c(0, 0)
sigma <- diag(2) * 100
data_trn <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = 300, mu = means, Sigma = sigma) |>  
    magrittr::set_colnames(str_c("x", 1:length(means))) |>  
    as_tibble()

data_val <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = 3000, mu = means, Sigma = sigma) |>  
    magrittr::set_colnames(str_c("x", 1:length(means))) |>  
    as_tibble()
```
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Write function for interactive DGP based on `x1` and `x2`
- Will map this over rows of d
- Can specify any values for b
- b[4] will be interaction parameter estimate
```{r}
b <- c(0, 0, 0, .5)

calc_p <- function(x, b){
   exp(b[1] + b[2]*x$x1 + b[3]*x$x2 + b[4]*x$x1*x$x2) /
     (1 + exp(b[1] + b[2]*x$x1 + b[3]*x$x2 + b[4]*x$x1*x$x2))
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add p and then observed classes to trn and val 

```{r}
data_trn <- data_trn |> 
  mutate(p = calc_p(data_trn, b)) |> 
  mutate(y = rbinom(nrow(data_trn), 1, p),
         y = factor(y, levels = 0:1, labels = c("neg", "pos")))

head(data_trn, 10)

data_val <- data_val |> 
  mutate(p = calc_p(data_val, b)) |> 
  mutate(y = rbinom(nrow(data_val), 1, p),
         y = factor(y, levels = 0:1, labels = c("neg", "pos")))
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Lets look at what an interactive DGP looks like for two features and a binary outcome
- Parameter estimates set up a "cross-over" interaction
```{r}
data_val |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = x1, y = x2, color = y)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fit models in trn 
```{r}
fit_lda <- 
  discrim_linear() |> 
  set_engine("MASS") |> 
  fit(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data_trn)

fit_lda_int <- 
  discrim_linear() |> 
  set_engine("MASS") |> 
  fit(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1*x2, data = data_trn)

fit_qda <- 
  discrim_regularized(frac_common_cov = 0, frac_identity = 0) |> 
  set_engine("klaR") |> 
  fit(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data_trn)

fit_qda_int <- 
  discrim_regularized(frac_common_cov = 0, frac_identity = 0) |> 
  set_engine("klaR") |> 
  fit(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1*x2, data = data_trn)
```

                                 length = n_points),
                   X2 = seq(min(data[[x_names[2]]]), 
                                 max(data[[x_names[2]]]),

  preds[[y_name]] <- as.numeric(preds[[y_name]])-1
  
  ggplot(data = data, 
         aes(x = .data[[x_names[1]]], 
             y = .data[[x_names[2]]], 
             color = .data[[y_name]])) +

                     z = .data[[y_name]]), 
                 color = "black", breaks = .5, linewidth = 2) +
    labs(x = x_names[1], y = x_names[2], color = y_name)

                         n_points = 400)

```
 
- Costs for QDA vs. LDA interactive in this example and more generally with more features?
- What if you were using RDA, which can model the full range of models between linear and quadratic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Categorical predictors

- All algorithms so far require numeric features
- Ordinal can be made numeric sometimes by just substituting ordered vector (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc)
- Nominal needs something more
- Our go to method is dummy features
  - What is big problem with dummy features?
  - Collapsing levels?
  - Difference between dummy coding and one-hot encoding
  - What is "dummy variable trap?" with one-hot
  - Issue of binary scores for LDA/QDA
  
- Target encoding example
  - Country of origin for car example (but maybe think of many countries?)
  - Why not data leakage?
  - Problems with step_mutate()
  - Can manually do it with our current resampling
  - See `step_lencode_*()` in [embed package](https://embed.tidymodels.org/)
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DGP and Errors

- DGP on probability
- what is irreducible error for classification?
- DGP on X1 - draw it with varying degrees of error  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DGP and error on two features

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bayes Classifier
 
The previous figure below displays simulated data for a classification problem for K = 2 classes as a function of `X1` and `X2`

The Bayes classifier assigns each observation its most likely class given its conditional probabilities for the values for `X1` and `X2`

- $Pr(Y = k | X = x_0) for\:k = 1:K$
- For K = 2, this means assigning to the class with Pr > .50
- This decision boundary for the two class problem is displayed in the figure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bayes classifier provides the minimum error rate for test data

- Error rate for any $x_0$ will be $1 - max (Pr( Y = k | X = x_0))$
- Overall error rate will be the average of this across all possible X
- This is the irreducible error for classification problems
- This is a theoretical model b/c (except for simulated data), we don't know the conditional probabilities based on X
- Many classification models try to estimate these conditionals
