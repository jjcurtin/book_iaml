# Resampling Methods for Model Selection and Evaluation


## Overview of Unit

### Learning Objectives

* Bias vs. variance wrt model performance estimates
  * How is this different from bias vs. variable of model itself
* How to do parallel processing
* Types of resampling
  * Validation set approach
  * Leave One Out CV
  * K-Fold and Repeated K-Fold
  * Grouped K-Fold
  * Bootstrap resampling
* Use of resampling for tuning hyperparameters  
* Combining these resampling approaches with a Test set
  * Used for simultaneous model selection and evaluation
  * Single independent test set
  * Advanced topic: Nested resampling
