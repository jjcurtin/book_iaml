EDA: Cleaning (full dataset)\n2. EDA: Split data into training, validation and test set(s)\n3. EDA: Modeling (training sets)\n4. Model Building: Feature engineering (training sets)\n5. Model Building: Fit many models configurations (training set)\n6. Model Building: Evaluate many models configurations (validation sets)\n7. Final Model Evaluation: Select final/best model configuration (validation sets)\n8. Final Model Evaluation: Fit best model configuration (use both training and validation sets)\n9. Final Model Evaluation: Evaluate final model configuration (test sets)\n10. Final Model Evaluation: Fit best model configuration to ALL data (training, validation, and test sets) if you plan to use it for applications.\n\n-----\n\nThe earlier stages are highly iterative:\n\n- You may iterate some through EDA stages 1-3 if you find further errors to clean in stage 3 [**But make sure you resplit into the same sets**]\n- You will iterate many times though stages 3-6 as you learn more about your data both through EDA for modeling and evaluating actual models in validation\n\nYou will NOT iterate back to earlier stages after you select a final model configuration\n\n- Stages 7 - 10 are performed ONLY ONCE\n- Only one model configuration is selected and re-fit and only that model is brought into test for evaluation\n- Any more than this is essentially equivalent to p-hacking in traditional analyses\n- Step 10 only happens if you plan to use the model in some application\n\n-----\n\n## Best Practices and Other Recommendations\n\n### Data file formats\n\nWe generally store data as CSV [comma-separated value] files\n\n- Easy to **view directly** in a text editor\n- Easy to **share** because others can use/import into any data analysis platform\n- Works with **version control** (e.g. git, svn)\n- use `read_csv()` and `write_csv()`\n\nExceptions include: \n\n- We **may** consider binary (.rds) format for very big files because read/write can be slow for csv files.  \n- Binary file format provides a very modest additional protection for sensitive data (which we also don't share)\n- use `read_rds()` and `write_rds()`\n\n\nSee [chapter 7 - Data Import](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-import) in @RDS for more details and advanced techniques for importing data using `read_csv()`\n\n-----\n\n### Classing Variables\nWe store and class variables in R based on their data type (level of measurement).\n\n- See Wikipedia definitions for [levels of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement) for a bit more precision that we will provide here.\n\nCoarsely, there are four levels:\n\n- nominal:  qualitative categories, no inherent order (e.g., marital status, sex, car color)\n- ordinal: qualitative categories (sometimes uses number), inherent order but not equidistant spacing (e.g., Likert scale; education level)\n- interval and ratio (generally treated the same in social sciences): quantitative scores, ordered, equidistant spacing.  Ratio has true 0.  (e.g., temperature in Celsius vs. Kelvin scales)\n\nWe generally refer to nominal and ordinal variables as categorical and interval/ratio as quantitative or numeric \n\n-----\n\nFor **nominal** variables\n\n- We store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n  - Easier to share/document\n  - Reduces errors\n- We class these variables in R as factors when we load them (using `read_csv()`)\n- In some cases, we should pay attention to the order of the levels of the variable. e.g., \n  - For a dichotomous outcome variable, the positive/event level of dichotomous factor outcome should be first level of the factor\n  - The order of levels may also matter for factor predictors (e.g., `step_dummy()` uses first level as reference).\n\n-----\n\nFor **ordinal** variables: \n\n- We store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\t- Easier to share/document\n\t- Reduces errors\n- We class these variables in R as factors (just like nominal variables)\n  - It is easier to do EDA with these variables classes as factors\n  - We use standard factors (not ordered)\n- Confirm that the order of the levels is set up correctly.  This is very important for ordinal variables.\n- During feature engineering stage, we can then either\n  - Treat as a nominal variable and create features using `step_dummy()`\n  - Treat as an interval variable using `step_ordinalscore()`\n\n\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both nominal and ordinal variable\n\nOrdinal variables may show non-linear relations b/c they may not be evenly spaced.  In these instances, we can use feature engineering approaches that are also used for nominal variables\n\n-----\n\nFor **interval and ratio** variables:\n\n- We store these variables as numeric\n- We class these variables as numeric (either integer or double - let R decide) during the read and clean stage (They are typically already in this class when read in)\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both interval and ratio variables\n\nSimilar feature engineering approaches are used with both\n\n-----\n\n### Data Dictionaries\n\nYou should always make a data dictionary for use with your data files.  \n\n- Ideally, these are created during the planning phase of your study, prior to the start of data collection\n- Still useful if created at the start of data analysis\n\nData dictionaries:\n\n- help you keep track of your variables and their characteristics (e.g., valid ranges, valid responses)\n- can be used by you to check your data during EDA\n- can be provided to others when you share your data (data are not generally useful to others without a data dictionary)\n\nWe will see a variety of data dictionaries throughout the course.   Many are not great as you will learn.\n\n-----\n\n### The Ames Housing Prices Dataset\n\nWe will use the Ames Housing Prices dataset as a running example this unit (and some future units and application assignments as well)\n\n- You can [read more](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) about the original dataset created by Dean DeCock \n\n- The data set contains data from home sales of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa\nfrom 2006 to 2010\n\n- The original data set includes 2930 observations of sales price and a large number of explanatory\nvariables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous)\n\n- This is the [original data dictionary](data/ames_data_dictionary.pdf)\n\n- The challenge with this dataset is to build the best possible prediction model for the\nsale price of the homes.\n\n-----\n\n### Packages and Conflicts\nFirst, lets set up our environment with functions from important packages.  I strongly recommend reviewing our recommendations for best practices regarding [managing function conflicts](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_dwvt/conflicts.html) now. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future.\n\n- We set a conflicts policy that will produce errors if we have unanticipated conflicts.\n- We source a library of functions that we use for common tasks in machine learning.  \n  - This includes a function (`tidymodels_conflictRules()`) that sets conflict rules to allow us to attach `tidymodels` functions without conflicts with `tidyverse` functions.  \n  - You can [review](https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true) that function to see what it does (search for that function name at the link)\n- Then we use that function\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(conflicts.policy = \"depends.ok\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true\")\ntidymodels_conflictRules()\n```\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\nNext we load packages for functions that we will use regularly.  There are five things to note RE best practices\n\n1. If we will use a lot of functions from a package (e.g., `tidyverse`, `tidymodels`), we attach the full package\n2. If we will use only several functions from a package (but plan to use them repeatedly), we use the `include.only` parameter to just attach those functions.\n3.  At times, if we plan to use a single function from a package only 1-2x times, we may not even attach that function at all.  Instead, we just call it using its namespace (i.e.  `packagename::functionname`)\n4. If a package has a function that conflicts with our primary packages and we don't plan to use that function, we load the package but exclude the function.  If we really needed it, we can call it with its namespace as per option 3 above.\n5. Pay attention to conflicts that were allowed to make sure you understand and accept them. (I left the package messages and warnings in the book this time to see them. I will hide them to avoid cluttering book in later units but you should always review them.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(janitor, include.only = \"clean_names\") # <1>\nlibrary(cowplot, include.only = \"plot_grid\") # <2> \nlibrary(kableExtra, exclude = \"group_rows\") # <3> \nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(tidymodels) # <4>\n```\n:::\n\n1. As an alternative, we could have skipped loading the package and instead called the function as `janitor::clean_names()`\n2. Same is true for `cowplot` package\n3. When loading `kableExtra` (which we use often), you will always need to exclude `groups_rows()` to prevent a conflict with `dplyr` package in the tidyverse\n4. Loading tidymodels will produce conflicts unless you source and call my function `tidymodels_conflictRules()` (see above)\n\n-----\n\n### Source and Other Environment Settings\nWe will also source (from github) two other libraries of functions that we use commonly for exploratory data analyses.  You should review these function scripts ([fun_eda.R](https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true); [fun_plots.R](https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true) to see the code for these functions. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, we tune our environment a bit more by setting plot themes and print options that we prefer\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\noptions(tibble.width = Inf, tibble.print_max = Inf)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd we set a relative path to our data.  This assumes you are using an RStudio project with the path to the data relative to that project file.  I've provided more detail [elsewhere](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_dwvt/file_and_path_management.html) on best practices for managing files and paths.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npath_data <- \"data\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\n### Read and Glimpse Dataframe\nLets read in the data and glimpse the subset of observations we will work with in Units 2-3 and the first two application assignments.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_raw_class.csv\"),   # <1>\n                     col_types = cols()) |> # <2> \n

First we read data using a relative path and the `here::here()` function.  This is a replacement for `file.path()` that works better for both interactive use and rendering in Quarto when using projects.\n2.  We use `col_types = cols()` to let R guess the correct class for each column. This suppresses messages that aren't important at this point prior to EDA.\n3. It is good practice to always `glimpse()` data after you read it.\n\n-----\n\nDataset Notes: \n\n- Dataset has N = 1955 rather than 2930.\n  - I have held out remaining observations to serve as a test set for a friendly competition in Unit 3\n  - I will judge your models' performance with this test set at that time!\n  - More on the importance of held out test sets as we progress through the course\n\n- This full dataset has 81 variables.

Notice that the dataset used non-standard variable names that include spaces. We need to use back-ticks around the variable names to allow us reference those variables. We will fix this during the cleaning process and you should never use spaces in variable names when setting up your own data!!! \n\n-----\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Cleaning\n\nEDA *could* be done using either `tidyverse` packages and functions or `tidymodels` (mostly using the `recipes` package.)\n\n- We prefer to use the richer set of functions available in the tidyverse (and `dplyr` and `purrr` packages in particular).\n\n- We will reserve the use of recipes for feature engineering only when we are building features for models that we will fit in our training sets and evaluation in our validation and test sets.  \n\n-----\n\n### Data Leakage Issues\nData leakage refers to a mistake made by the developer of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between their training set and held-out validation or test sets\n\n- Training sets are used to fit models with different configurations\n- Validation sets are used to select the best model among those with different configurations (not needed if you only have one configuration)\n- Test sets are used to evaluate a best model\n\n- When splitting data-sets into training, validation and test sets, the goal is to ensure that no data (or information more broadly) are shared between the three sets\n  - No data or information from test should influence either fitting or selecting models \n  - Test should only be used once to evaluate a best/final model\n  - Train and validation set also must be segregated (although validation sets may be used to evaluate many model configurations)\n  - Information necessary for transformations and other feature engineering (e.g., means/sds for centering/scaling, procedures for missing data imputation) must all be based only on training data.\n  - Data leakage is common if you are not careful.\n\nIn particular, if we begin to use test data or information about test during model fitting\n\n- We risk overfitting\n- This is essentially the equivalent of p-hacking in traditional analyses\n- Our estimate of model performance will be too optimistic, which could have harmful real-world consequences.\n\n-----\n\n### Tidy variable names\n\nUse snake case for variable names\n\n- `clean_names()` from `janitor` package is useful for this.\n- May need to do further correction of variable names using `rename()`\n- See more details about tidy names for objects (e.g., variables, dfs, functions) per [Tidy Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#object-names)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  clean_names(\"snake\")\n\ndata_all |> names()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"sale_price\"   \"gr_liv_area\"  \"lot_area\"     \"year_built\"   \"overall_qual\"\n [6] \"garage_cars\"  \"garage_qual\"  \"ms_zoning\"    \"lot_config\"   \"bldg_type\"   \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\n### Explore variable classes\n\nAt this point, we should class all of our variables as either numeric or factor\n\n- Interval and ratio variables use numeric classes (dbl or int)\n- Nominal and ordinal variable use factor class\n- Useful for variable selection later (e.g., `where(is.numeric)`, `where(is.factor)`)\n\nSubsequent cleaning steps are clearer if we have this established/confirmed now\n\n-----\n\nWe have a number of nominal or ordinal variables that are classed as character. \n\nWe have one ordinal variable (`overall_qual`) that is classed as numeric (because the levels were coded with numbers rather than text)\n\n- `read_csv()` thought was numeric by the levels are coded using numbers\n- The data dictionary indicates that valid values range from 1 - 10.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all |> glimpse()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   <dbl> 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  <dbl> 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     <dbl> 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   <dbl> 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual <dbl> 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  <dbl> 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  <chr> \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA…\n$ ms_zoning    <chr> \"RL\", \"RH\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL…\n$ lot_config   <chr> \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Inside\", \"Inside…\n$ bldg_type    <chr> \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"TwnhsE\", \"TwnhsE\", \"Twnh…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can the recode `overall_qual` first and set its levels\n\nWe can recode all the character variables to factor in one step.

It is always best to explicitly set the levels of an ordinal factor in the order you prefer.  It is not necessary here because `overall_qual` was numeric and therefore sorts in the expected order.  However, if it had been numbers stored as characters, it could sort incorrectly (e.g., 1, 10, 2, 3, ...).  And obviously if the orders levels were names, the order would have to be specified.\n2. We indicate the levels here.\n3. We use a mutate to re-class all character data to factors.  I prefer `factor()` to `forcats::fct()` because factor orders the levels alphabetically.  Be aware that this *could* change if your code is used in a region of the world where this sorting is different.  I still prefer this to the alternative (in `fct()`) that orders by the order the levels are found in your data.\n\n-----\n\n### Skimming the data\n\n`skim()` from the `skimr` package is a wonderful and customizable function for summary statistics\n\n- It is highly customizable so we can write our own versions for our own needs\n- We use different versions for cleaning and modeling EDA\n- For cleaning EDA, we just remove some stats that we don't want to see at this time\n- We can get many of the summary stats for cleaning in one call \n- We have a custom skim defined in the `fun_eda.R` function library that we use regularly.

We will correct this in our data set.  \n\nThis is a pretty poor choice on the part of the researchers who created the dataset because it becomes impossible to distinguish between `NA` that means no garage vs. true NA for the variable.  In fact, if you later do really careful EDA on the full data set with all variables, you will see this problem likely exists in this dataset\n\nAnyway, let's correct all the `NA` for `garage_qual` to \"no_garage\" using `mutate()` \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  mutate(garage_qual = fct_expand(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"), # <1>\n         garage_qual = replace_na(garage_qual, \"no_garage\")) # <2>\n```\n:::\n\n1. First add a new level to the factor\n2. Then recode NA to that new level\n\nWe will leave the `NA` for `garage_cars` as `NA` because its not clear if that is truly missing or not, based on further EDA not shown here.\n\n-----\n\nWe have one other issue with `garage_qual`.  It is an ordinal variable but we never reviewed the order of its levels.  The data dictionary indicates the levels are ordered (best to worst) as:\n\n- Ex (excellent)\n- Gd (good)\n- TA (typical/average)\n- Fa (fair)\n- Po (poor)\n\nAnd we might assume that no garage is even worse than a poor garage.  Lets see what they are.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all$garage_qual |> levels()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Ex\"        \"Fa\"        \"Gd\"        \"Po\"        \"TA\"        \"no_garage\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo fix this, we can use `forcats::fct_relevel()`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngq_levels <- c(\"no_garage\", \"Po\", \"Fa\", \"TA\", \"Gd\", \"Ex\") # <1>\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  mutate(garage_qual = fct_relevel(garage_qual, gq_levels)) # <2>\n\ndata_all$garage_qual |> levels() # <3>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"no_garage\" \"Po\"        \"Fa\"        \"TA\"        \"Gd\"        \"Ex\"       \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n1.

We don't assign to new df to an object\n- We can use `skim_some()` again\n  - p0 = min\n  - p100 = max\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all |>\n  mutate(overall_qual = as.numeric(overall_qual)) |> \n  skim_some() |> \n  filter(skim_type == \"numeric\") |>  # <1>\n  select(skim_variable, numeric.p0, numeric.p100) # <2>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  skim_variable numeric.p0 numeric.p100\n  <chr>              <dbl>        <dbl>\n1 sale_price         12789       745000\n2 gr_liv_area          438         5642\n3 lot_area            1476       215245\n4 year_built          1875         2010\n5 overall_qual           1           10\n6 garage_cars            0            4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n1.

We often use anonymous functions when using the functions from the `purrr` package (e.g., `map()`, `walk()`) \n- We use `walk()` from the `purrr` package to apply our anonymous function to all columns of the data frame at once\n- Just copy this code for now\n- We will see simpler uses later that will help you understand iteration with `purrr` functions\n- See the chapter on [iteration](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration) in *R for Data Science (2e)* for more info on `map()` and `walk()`\n\n-----\n\n### Tidy Responses for Categorical Variables\n\nFeature engineering with nominal and ordinal variables typically involves \n\n- Converting to factors (already did this!)\n- Often creating dummy features from these factors\n\nThis feature engineering will use response labels for naming new features\n\n- Therefore, it is a good idea to have the responses snake-cased and cleaned up a bit so that these new feature names are clean/clear.\n\nHere is an easy way to convert responses for character variables to snake case using a function (`tidy_responses()`) we share in `fun_eda.R` (reproduced here). \n\n- This uses regular expressions (regex), which will will learn about in a later unit on text processing.\n- You could expand this cleaning function if you encounter other issues that need to be cleaned in the factor levels.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy_responses <- function(column){\n  # replace all non-alphanumeric with _\n  column <- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\W\", \"_\"))\n  # replace whitespace with _\n  column <- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\s+\", \"_\"))\n  # replace multiple _ with single _\n  column <- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_+\", \"_\"))\n  #remove _ at end of string\n  column <- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_$\", \"\"))\n  # remove _ at start of string\n  column <- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\^_\", \"\"))\n  # convert to lowercase\n  column <- fct_relabel(column, tolower)\n  factor(column)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\nLet's use the function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  mutate(across(where(is.factor), tidy_responses)) # <1>\n```\n:::\n\n1. We use the tidy selection helper function to limit our mutate to only factors.  See [more details](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/language.html) on the tidy selection helpers like `all_of()` and `where()`\n\n-----\n\nAlas, these response labels were pretty poorly chosen so some didn't convert well.  And some are really hard to understand too.\n\n- Avoid this problem and choose good response labels from the start for your own data\n- Here, we show you what we got from using `tidy_responses()`\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all |> \n  select(where(is.factor)) |>\n  walk(\\(column) print(levels(column)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"1\"  \"2\"  \"3\"  \"4\"  \"5\"  \"6\"  \"7\"  \"8\"  \"9\"  \"10\"\n[1] \"no_garage\" \"po\"        \"fa\"        \"ta\"        \"gd\"        \"ex\"       \n[1] \"a_agr\" \"c_all\" \"fv\"    \"i_all\" \"rh\"    \"rl\"    \"rm\"   \n[1] \"corner\"  \"culdsac\" \"fr2\"     \"fr3\"     \"inside\" \n[1] \"1fam\"   \"2fmcon\" \"duplex\" \"twnhs\"  \"twnhse\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\nLets clean them up a bit more manually\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  mutate(ms_zoning = fct_recode(ms_zoning,\n                                res_low = \"rl\",\n                                res_med = \"rm\",\n                                res_high = \"rh\",\n                                float = \"fv\",\n                                agri = \"a_agr\",\n                                indus = \"i_all\",\n                                commer = \"c_all\"),\n         bldg_type = fct_recode(bldg_type,   # <1>\n                                one_fam = \"1fam\",\n                                two_fam = \"2fmcon\",\n                                town_end = \"twnhse\",\n                                town_inside = \"twnhs\"))\n```\n:::\n\n1. Note that I did not need to list all levels in the recode.  Only the levels I wanted to change.\n\nThe full dataset is now clean!\n\n-----\n\n### Train/Validate/Test Splits\n\nThe final task we typically do as part of the data preparation process is to split the full dataset into training, validation and test sets.\n\n- Test sets are \"typically\" between 20-30% of your full dataset\n  - There are costs and benefits to larger test sets\n  - We will learn about these costs/benefits in the unit on resampling\n  - I have already held out the test set\n  \n- There are many approaches to validation sets\n  - For now (until unit 5) we will use a single validation set approach\n  - We will use 25% of the remaining data (after holding out the test set) as a validation set for this example\n\n- It is typical to split data on the outcome within strata\n  - For a categorical outcome, this makes the proportions of the response categories more balanced across the train, validation, and test sets\n  - For a numeric outcome, we first break up the distribution into temporary bins (see `breaks = 4` below) and then we split within these bins\n- **IMPORTANT**: Set a seed so that you can reproduce these splits if you later do more cleaning\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(20110522)\nsplits <- data_all |> \n  initial_split(prop = 3/4, strata = \"sale_price\", breaks = 4)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\nWe then extract the training set from the splits and save it\n\n- Training sets are used for \"analysis\"- hence the name of the function\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsplits |> \n  analysis() |> # <1> \n  glimpse() |> \n  write_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   <dbl> 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  <dbl> 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     <dbl> 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   <dbl> 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual <fct> 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  <dbl> 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  <fct> ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    <fct> res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   <fct> inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    <fct> one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n1. `analysis()` pulls out the training set from our splits of `data_all`\n\n-----\n\nWe will not need the validation set for modeling EDA\n\n- It should NOT be used for anything other than evaluating models to select the best model configuration\n- We do NOT do Modeling EDA or Model Fitting with the validation set\n- Save it in this clean form for easy use when you need it\n- We use the validation set to \"assess\" models that we have fit in training sets -

For example:\n  - Transforming factors into \"dummy\" features if needed\n  - Linear and non-linear transformations (e.g., log, box-cox)\n  - Polynomials and interactions (i.e., `x1 * x1` or `x1 * x2`)\n  - Missing value imputations\n- Proper use of recipes is an important tool to prevent data leakage between train and either validation or test.\n- Recipes use only information from the training set in all feature engineering\n- Consider example of standardizing `x1` for a feature in train vs. validation and test.  Must use mean and sd from TRAIN to standardize `x1` in train, validate, and test.  VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n-----\n\nWe use recipes in a two step process - `prep()` and `bake()`\n  \n- \"Prepping\" a recipe involves calculating any statistics needed for the transformations that will be applied to engineer features (e.g., mean and standard deviation to normalize a numeric variable).\n  - Prepping is done with the `prep()` function.\n  - Prepping is **always** done only with training data.  A \"prepped\" recipe does not derive any statistics from validation or test sets.\n\n- \"Baking\" is the process of calculating the features\n  - Baking is done with the `bake()` function.\n  - We used our prepped recipe when we bake.\n  - Whereas we only prep a recipe with training data, we can use a prepped recipe to bake features from any dataset (training, validation, or test).\n\n-----\n\nWe will work with recipes extensively when model building starting in unit 3\n\nFor now, we will only use the recipe to indicate roles as a gentle introduction.\n\nWe will expand on this recipe in unit 3\n\nRecipe syntax is very similar to generic `tidyverse` syntax (created by same group)\n\n- Actually a subset of `tidyverse` functions\n- Less flexible/powerful but focused on our needs and easier to learn\n- You will eventually know both\n\n-----\n\nRecipes are used in Modeling scripts (which is a third type of script after cleaning and modeling EDA scripts)\n\n- Lets reload training again to pretend we are starting a new script\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n data_trn <- read_csv(file.path(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"), \n                      col_types = cols()) |> \n  class_ames() |> # <1> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   <dbl> 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  <dbl> 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     <dbl> 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   <dbl> 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual <fct> 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  <dbl> 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  <fct> ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    <fct> res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   <fct> inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    <fct> one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n1.

This makes sure that are recipes will always only use information from the training set when making features for any subsequent dataset.  As part of the prepping process, `prep()` calculates and saves the features for the training data for later use\n\n-----\n\nSecond, we bake the training data using this prepped recipe to get a feature matrix from it.  \n\\\n\\\nWe set `new_data = NULL` because don't need features for new data.

Review\n    - Goal is to develop model that closely approximates DGP\n    - Goal is to evaluate (estimate) how close our model is to the DGP (how much error) with as little error as possible\n    - Bias, overfitting/variance for any estimate (model and performance of model)\n    - candidate model configurations\n    - fit, select, evaluate\n    - training, validation, test\n\n2. Review: 2.2.1 Stages of Data Analysis and Model Development\n\n3. Best practices (discuss quickly)\n    - csv for data sharing, viewing, git (though be careful with data in github or other public repo!)\n    - variable values saved as text when nominal and ordinal (self-documenting)\n    - Create data dictionary - Documentation is critical!!\n    - snake_case for variables and self-documenting names (systematic names too)\n\n4. Review: 2.3.1 Data Leakage Issues\n    - Review section in webbook\n    - Cleaning EDA is done with full dataset (but univariate).  Very limited (variable names, values, find errors)\n    - Modeling EDA is only done with a training set (or even \"eyeball\" sample) - NEVER use validate or test set\n    - Never estimate anything with full data set (e.g., missing values, standardize, etc)\n    - Use recipes, prep (all estimation) with held in data than bake the appropriate set\n    - Put test aside\n    - You work with validation but never explore with validation (will still catch leakage with test but will be mislead to be overly optimistic and spoil test)\n    \n5.
