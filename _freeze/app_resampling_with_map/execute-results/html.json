This will help us understand how these functions work under the hood and give us a better understanding of how to use them.  It will also give us an alternative way to do resampling if we need it.\n\nSpecifically, with respect to using resampling to get held-out performance estimates, we will\n\n- Gain a better understanding of the resampling object that is returns from `bootstraps()` and `vfold_cv()`\n- Make more transparent how these functions incorporate loops as part of their computations\n- Be able to reproduce these computations, manually for when we can't use these functions directly.\n  - This might be if we want to loop over model configurations that are not defined by differece in hyperparameters but instead by other characteristics (e.g., different recipes, different statistical algorithms).  \n  - We want to use an algorigthm that is not supported by tidymodels (e.g., we are developing deep neural networks outside of tidymodels by directly using the keras package)\n- We want to do nested resampling (e.g., using `bootstraps()` to both select a best model configuration and evaluate that best configuration with the variance benefits that are offered by nested cv relative to using a single held out test set.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore generally, we will also gain a better understanding (and some code examples) of the use of list columns with iteration via `map()`.  \n\n- This has many other uses than just resampling.  \n- Wickham has writting about this in more detail [elsewhere](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this appendix, we will work through four separate examples that build in complexity\n\n- First, we will reproduce `fit_resamples()` computations by using `map()` to loop over the splits and fit a single model to each split.  We use separate independent `maps()` for each step\n- Next, we will do this again but by wrapping all the steps into one function and using a single call to `map()` to loop that function over the splits.\n- The third example, will reproduce `tune_grid()` by using two nested `map()`s to loop over the splits and the hyper-parameter grid.  \n- The final example will demonstrate how to do nested resampling using `map()`  Nested resampling includes both an outer and inner loop across different out and inner splits.  There is also an innermost loop across values in a hyper-parameter grid (or any other grid that defines different model configurations) \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Set up\n\nLets start all of these examples by....\n\n\nLoading libraries\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCreating a simple data set that has 300 observationns and two predictors (`x1` and `x2`) and one outcome (`y`).

Nested resampling involves looping over outer splits where the held out data are test sets used to evaluate best model configurations for each outer split and the inner loop makes validation sets that are used to select the best model configuration for each outer fold.  However, if we are tuning a grid of hyperparameters, there is even a further nested loop inside the inner resampling loop to get performance metrics for each value of the hyperparameter in the validation sets.\n\n`rsample` supports creating a nested resampling object.  \n\n- You can specify different resampling for the inner and outer loops.  \n- k-fold for the outer loop and bootstraps for the inner loop is a common choice.\n- However, neither `fit_resamples()` or `tune_grid()` support nested resampling.  So we will always need to use nested `map()` to do this ourselves.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, lets make the nested resampling object and explore it a bit\n\n- We will use 5-fold cv for the outer loop\n- We will use 10 bootstraps for the inner loop\n- These numbers were selected only to make the computations faster.  You may need more splits.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresamples_nested <- d |> \n  nested_cv(outside = vfold_cv(v = 5), inside = bootstraps(times = 10))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLets take a look at it.  \n\n- It has five rows for each of the five outer splits.

None are nested.  Switch them all to `future_map()`. \n- For our `tune_grid()` example, there are two nested `maps()`.  In most instances, you will want to switch the outer loop `map()` to `future_map()` and leave the inner `map()` as is.\n- For our nested example, there are three nested `map()`s.  In most instances, you will want to switch that outermost `map()` (across outer splits) to `future_map()` and leave the inner two `map()`s as is. - See our [post](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_dwvt/parallel_processing.html) on setting up parallel backends for more info on how to do that ",
