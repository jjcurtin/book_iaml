How we make decisions?\n\n![](figs/ISL_8.1.png){height=5in}\n\n-----\n\nYou can see these regions more clearly in the two-dimensional feature space displayed in figure 8.2\n\\\n\\\nNotice how even with a limited tree depth of 2, we can already get a complex partitioning of the feature space.\n\\\n\\\nDecision trees can encode complex decision boundaries (and even more complex than this as tree depth increases)\n\n![](figs/ISL_8.2.png){height=5in}\n\n-----\n\nThere are many methodologies for constructing decision trees but the most well-known is the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm proposed in Breiman (1984)\n\n- This algorithm is implemented in the `rpart` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) and this is the engine we will use in tidymodels for decision trees (and bagged trees - a more advance ensemble method)\n\n- The decision tree partitions the training data into homogeneous subgroups (i.e., groups with similar response values)\n- These subgroups are called **nodes**\n- The nodes are formed recursively using binary partitions by asking simple yes-or-no questions about each feature (e.g., are years in major league < 4.5?)\n- This is done a number of times until a suitable stopping criteria is satisfied, e.g., \n  - a maximum depth of the tree is reached\n  - minimum number of remaining observations is available in a node \n\n- After all the partitioning has been done, the model predicts a single value for each region\n  - mean response among all observations in the region for regression problems\n  - majority vote among all observations in the region for classification problems\n  - probabilities (for classification) can be obtained using the proportion of each class within the region\n  \n-----\n\nThe bottom left panel in Figure 8.3 shows a slightly more complicated tree with depth = 3 for two arbitrary predictors (`x1` and `x2`)\n\\\n\\\nThe right column shows a representation of the regions formed by this tree (top) and a 3D representation that includes predictions for y (bottom)\n\\\n\\\nThe top left panel displays a set of regions that is NOT possible using binary recursive splitting.  This makes the point that there are some patterns in the data that cannot be accommodated well by decision  trees\n\n![](figs/ISL_8.3.png){height=5in}\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8.4 shows a slightly more complicated decision tree for the hitters dataset with tree depth = 4.  With respect to terminology:\n\n- As noted earlier, each of the subgroups are called **nodes**\n- The first \"subgroup\"\" at the top of the tree is called the **root node**.  This node contains all of the training data. \n- The final subgroups at the bottom of the tree are called the **terminal nodes** or **leaves** (the \"tree\" is upside down) \n- Every subgroup in between is referred to as an **internal node**. \n- The connections between nodes are called **branches**\n\n \\\n \\\nThis tree also highlights another key point.  The same features can be used for splitting repeatedly throughout the tree. \n![](figs/ISL_8.4.png){height=5in}\n\n-----\n\nCART uses **binary recursive partitioning**\n\\\n\\\nRecursive simply means that each split (or rule) depends on the the splits above it:\n\n- The algorithm first identifies the \"best\" feature to partition the observations in the root node into one of two new regions (i.e., new nodes that will be on the left and right branches leading from the root node.)\n  -  For regression problems, the \"best\" feature (and the rule using that feature) is the feature that maximizes the reduction in SSE\n  - For classification problems, the split is selected to maximize the reduction in [cross-entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Information_gain) or the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity).  These are measures of impurity (and we want to get homogeneous nodes so we minimize them)\n  \n- The splitting process is then repeated on each of the two new nodes (hence the name binary recursive partitioning). \n- This process is continued until a suitable stopping criterion is reached.\n\n-----\n\nThe final depth of the tree is what affects the bias/variance trade-off for this algorithm\n\n- Deep trees (with smaller and smaller sized nodes) will have lower and lower bias but can become overfit to the training data\n- Shallow trees may be overly biased (underfit)\n\n-----\n\nThere are two primary approaches to achieve the optimal balance in the bias-variance trade-off\n\n- Early stopping\n- Pruning\n\n-----\n\nWith early stopping:\n\n- We explicitly stop the growth of the tree early based on a stopping rule. The two most common are:\n\n    - A maximum tree depth is reached\n    - The node has too few cases to be considered for further splits\n\n- These two stopping criteria can be implemented independently of each other but they do interact\n\n- They should ideally be tuned via the cross-validation approaches we have learned\n\n-----\n\nWith pruning, we let the tree grow large (max depth = 30 on 32-bit machines) and then prune it back to an optimal size:\n\n- To do this, we apply a penalty ($\\lambda$ * # of terminal nodes) to the cost function/impurity index (analogous to the L1/LASSO penalty). This penalty is also referred to as the cost complexity parameter\n\n- Big values for cost complexity will result in less complex trees.  Small values will result in deeper, more complex trees\n\n- Cost complexity can be tuned by our standard cross-validation approaches by itself or in combination with the previous two hyper parameters\n\n-----\n\nFeature engineering for decision trees can be simpler than with other algorithms because there are very few pre-processing requirements:\n\n- Monotonic transformations (e.g., power transformations) are not required to meet algorithm assumptions (in contrast to many parametric models).  These transformations only shift the location of the optimal split points.\n\n- Outliers typically do not bias the results as much since the binary partitioning simply looks for a single location to make a split within the distribution of each feature.\n\n- The algorithm will handle non-linear effects of features and interactions natively\n\n- Categorical predictors do not need pre-processing to convert to numeric (e.g., dummy coding). \n\n- For unordered categorical features with more than two levels, the classes are ordered based on the outcome\n  - For regression problems, the mean of the response is used\n  - For classification problems, the proportion of the positive outcome class is used. \n  - This means that aggregating response levels is not necessary\n\n- Most decision tree implementations (including the `rpart` engine) can easily handle missing values in the features and do not require imputation. In `rpart`, this is handled by using surrogate splits. \n\n\\\n\\\nIt is important to note that feature engineering (e.g., alternative strategies for missing data, categorical level aggregation) may still improve performance, but this algorithm does not have the same pre-processing requirements we have seen previously and will work fairly well \"out of the box\".\n\n-----\n\n## Decision Trees in Ames\n\nLet's see this algorithm in action\n\n- We will explore the decision tree algorithm (and ensemble approaches using it) with the Ames Housing Prices database\n- Parallel processing is VERY useful for ensemble approaches because they can be computationally costly\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\nRead the Ames dataset\n\n- All predictors\n- Set factors\n- Some tidying of variable names and

because the algorithm is very flexible\n- Will handle non-linear relationships and interactions natively\n- Dummy coding not needed (and generally not recommended) for factors\n- Not even very important to consider frequency of response categories\n- Not even necessary to convert character to factor (but I do to make it easy to do further feature engineering if desired)\n\n- Be careful with categorical variables which are coded with numbers\n  - They will be coded as numeric by R and treated as numeric by R\n  - If they are ordered (`overall_qual`), this a priori order would be respected by `rpart` so no worries\n  - If they are unordered, this will force an order on the levels rather than allowing `rpart` to determine an order based on the outcome in your training data.\n- Notice the missing data for features (`rpart` will handle it with *surrogates*)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrec <- recipe(sale_price ~ ., data = data_trn)\n \nrec_prep <- rec |> \n

Our first ensemble approach is bagging.\n\n-----\n\n## Bagging\n\n**Bootstrap aggregating (bagging)** prediction models involve:\n\n- Fitting multiple versions of a prediction model\n- Combining (or ensembling) them into an aggregated prediction\n- You can begin to learn more about bagging in the [original paper](pdfs/breiman1996a.pdf) that proposed the technique\n\n-----\n\nThe specific steps are:\n\n- B bootstraps of the original training data are created [NOTE: This is a new use for bootstrapping! More on that in a moment]\n- The model configuration (either regression or classification algorithm with a specific set of features and hyperparameters) is fit to each bootstrap sample\n- These individual fitted models are called the **base learners**\n- Final predictions are made by aggregating the predictions across all of the individual base learners\n  - For regression, this can be the average of base learner predictions\n  - For classification, it can be either the average of estimated class probabilities or majority class vote across individual base learners \n\n-----\n\nBagging effectively **reduces the variance of an individual base learner**\n\\\n\\\nHowever, bagging does not always improve on an individual base learner \n\n  - Bagging works especially well for flexible, high variance base learners (based on statistical algorithms or other characteristics of the problem)\n  - These base learners can become overfit to their training data\n  - Therefore base learners will produce different predictions across each bootstrap sample of the training data\n  - The aggregate predictions across base learners will be lower variance\n  - With respect to statistical algorithms that you know, decision trees are high variance (KNN also)\n  - In contrast, bagging a linear model (with low P to N ratio) would likely not improve much upon the base learners' performance\n\n-----\n\nBagging takes advantage of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" effect (Surowiecki, 2005)\n\n- Aggregation of information across large diverse groups often produces decisions that are better than any single member of the group\n- Regis Philbin once stated that the Ask the Audience lifeline on *Who Wants to be a Millionaire* is right 95% of the time\n- With more diverse group members and perspectives (i.e., high variance learners), we get better aggregated predictions\n\n-----\n\nWith decision trees, optimal performance is often found by bagging 50-500 base learner trees \n\n- Data sets that have a few strong features typically require fewer trees\n- Data sets with lots of noise or multiple strong features may need more\n- Using too many trees will NOT lead to overfitting, just no further benefit in variance reduction\n- However, too many trees will increase computational costs (particularly if you are also using \"an outer loop\" of resampling to select among configurations or to evaluate the model)\n\n-----\n\nBagging uses bootstrap resampling for yet another goal.  We can use bootstrapping\n\n- For cross-validation to assess performance model configuration(s)\n  - Select among model model configurations\n  - Evaluate a final model configuration (if we don't have independent test set)\n- For estimating standard errors and confidence intervals of statistics (no longer part of this course - see Appendix)\n- And now for building multiple base learners whose aggregate predictions are lower variance than any of the individual base learners\n \n-----\n\nWhen bagging, we can (and typically will):\n\n- Use an \"outer loop\" of bootstrap resampling to select among model configurations \n- While using an \"inner loop\" of bootstrapping to fit multiple base learners for any specific configuration\n- This inner loop is *often* opaque to users (more on this in a moment), happening under the hood in the algorithm (e.g., Random Forest) or the implementation of the code (`bagged_tree()`)\n\n-----\n\n## Bagging Trees in Ames\n\nWe will now use `bag_tree()` rather than `decision_tree()` from the `baguette` package.

however, Breiman’s algorithm (Breiman 2001) has largely become the standard procedure. \n- We will use the `ranger` engine implementation of this algorithm\n\n-----\n\nRandom forests build on decision trees (its base learners) and bagging to reduce final model variance.\n\\\n\\\nSimply bagging trees is not optimal to reduce final model variance\n\n- The trees in bagging are not completely independent of each other since all the original features are considered at every split of every tree. \n\n- Trees from different bootstrap samples typically have similar structure to each other (especially at the top of the tree) due to any underlying strong relationships\n\n- The trees are correlated (not as diverse a set of base learners)\n\n-----\n\nRandom forests help to reduce tree correlation by injecting more randomness into the tree-growing process\n\\\n\\\nMore specifically, while growing a decision tree during the bagging process, random forests perform split-variable randomization where each time a split is to be performed, the search for the best split variable is limited to a random subset of `mtry`  of the original `p` features. \n\\\n\\\nBecause the algorithm randomly selects a bootstrap sample to train on and a random sample of features to use at each split, a more diverse set of trees is produced which tends to lessen tree correlation beyond bagged trees and often dramatically increases predictive power.\n\n-----\n\nThere are three primary hyper-parameters to consider tuning in random forests within `tidymodels`\n\n- `mtry`\n- `trees`\n- `min_n`\n\n-----\n\n`mtry`\n\n- The number of features to randomly select for splitting on each split\n- Selection of value for `mtry` balances low tree correlation with reasonable predictive strength\n- Good starting values for `mtry` are $\\frac{p}{3}$ for regression and $\\sqrt{p}$ for classification\n- When there are fewer relevant features (e.g., noisy data) a higher value may be needed to make it more likely to select those features with the strongest signal. \n- When there are many relevant features, a lower value might perform better\n- Default in `ranger` is $\\sqrt{p}$\n\n-----\n\n`trees`\n  \n- The number of bootstrap resamples of the training data to fit decision tree base learners\n- The number of trees needs to be sufficiently large to stabilize the error rate. \n- A good rule of thumb is to start with 10 times the number of features\n- You may need to adjust based on values for `mtry` and `min_n`\n- More trees provide more robust and stable error estimates and variable importance measures\n- More trees ==  more computational cost\n- Default in `ranger` is 500\n  \n-----\n  \n`min_n`  \n\n- Minimum number of observations in a new node rather than min to split\n- Note that this is different than its definition for decision trees and bagged trees\n- You can consider the defaults (above) as a starting point\n- If your data has many noisy predictors and higher `mtry` values are performing best, then performance may improve by increasing node size (i.e., decreasing tree depth and complexity). \n- If computation time is a concern then you can often decrease run time substantially by increasing the node size and have only marginal impacts to your error estimate\n- Default in ranger is 1 for classification and 5 for regression\n\n-----\n\n### Random Forest in Ames\n\nLet's see how de-correlated the base learner trees improves their aggregate performance\n\\\n\\\nWe will need a new recipe for Random Forest\n\n- Random Forest works well out of the box with little feature engineering\n- It is still aggregating decision trees in bootstrap resamples of the training data\n- However, the Random Forest algorithm does not natively handling missing data.  We need to handle missing data manually during feature engineering.

`grid_rf` using `tune_grid()`\n\n`ranger` gives you a lot of additional control by changing defaults in `set_engine()`. \n  \n- We will mostly use defaults\n- You should explore if you want to get the best performance from your models\n- see `?ranger` \n\n- Defaults for splitting rules are `gini` for classification and `variance` for regression.  These are appropriate\n- We will explicitly specify `respect.unordered.factors = \"order\"` as recommended.  Could consider `respect.unordered.factors = \"partition\"`\n- We will set `oob.error = FALSE`.  TRUE would allow for OOB performance estimate using OOB for each bootstrap for each base learner.

Explain how decision tree algorithm works generally\n\n2. How does CART and RF handle categorical variables?  What about other transformations of predictors (normalize, scale, combine)? [non-linear?](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/DT.html#partitioning)\n\n3. How do you do bagging for decision trees?  How do you select best bagged tree?\n\n4. When and Why does bagging improve model performance\n\n5. Why does bagging not work optimally and how does random forest improve on it?\n\n\n\n### New Questions\n\n#### Interpretability\n- Can you explain how boosting decision trees are more interpretable than random forest? I understand that it builds on top each model so that it slowly grows over time reducing the residuals from the models, but I'm still confused on it's interpretability.\n\n- Could we please discuss the interpretability of parametric vs machine learning models vs decision tree models. It seems that machine learning and smaller decision tree models are relatively easy to interpret, yet in a lot of papers the interpretability of such models is viewed as a negative in comparison to parametric models. \n\n- Are able to determine the directionality of how the features are impacting the outcome)\n\n#### Feature engineering\n- Why do decision tree models not require feature engineering of nominal variables, whereas random forest models do?\n\n- how will decision tree handle missing values in features? \n\n- I am very interested in and still a little bit confused about how random forest and decision trees can run with such minimal feature engineering. I would like to hear a little bit more about how these methods differ in comparison to previous methods we've used, which have required much more feature engineering\n\n#### Bagging\n\n- How does bagging affect the bias specifically?\n\n- I am interested in understanding better how techniques like bagging can reduce variance so drastically without seeming to affect bias much.\n\n- Bagging and random forests have no impact on model bias, correct?\n\n- Is it correct that we will not use bagged trees in any situations? \n\n- I am still confuse of difference between using bootstrap on decision tree and bagging\n\n#### Bootstrap\n\n- What is the difference of bagging and normal bootstraps?\n- What are the \"outer loop\" and \"inner loop\" of bagging?\n\n#### Random Forest\n\n- What are the differences between decision trees and random forests? When do you want to use a decision tree versus a random forest?\n\n- Could you explain a method of Variable Selection for Random Forest?\n\n- Is the logic for preferring random forests over bagging essentially the same as the logic for preferring k-fold cross-validation with k < n over LOOCV?\n\n- Can you talk more about real world use in random forest? \n\n#### Boosting\n\n- Boosting a decision tree\n- boosting versus other ensemble techniques like random forest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
