compact model:  $y = b_0 + b_1*x_1 + b_2*x_2$\n  - full (augmented) model: $y = b_0 + b_1*x_1 + b_2*x_2 + b_3*x_3$\n  - The comparison of these two models is equivalent to the test of $H_0: b_3 = 0$\n\n\\\n\\\nThis can also involve sets of features if you hypothesis involves the effect of a set of features\n\n  - All features that represent a categorical predictor\n  - Set of features that represent some broad construct (e.g., psychiatric illness represented by symptoms counts for all of the major psychiatric diagnoses)\n  \n\\\n\\\nThis technique of comparing two nested models (i.e. feature set for the compact model is a subset of the feature set for the full/augmented model) is often called **feature ablation** in the machine learning world\n\n-----\n\nModel comparisons can also be done between model configurations that differ by characteristics other than their features (e.g., statistical algorithm)\n\\\n\\\nModel comparisons can be useful to determine the best available model configuration to use for a prediction goal\n\n- In some instances, it is OK to simply choose the descriptively better performing model configuration (e.g., better validation set or resampled performance estimate)\n- However, if the descriptively better performing model has other disadvantages (e.g., more costly to implement) you might want to only use it if you had rigorously demonstrated that it likely better for all new data.\n\n-----\n\nIn this unit, we will learn two approaches to statistically compare models\n\n- Traditional frequentist (NHST) approach using a variant of the t-test to accommodate correlated observations\n- A Bayesian alternative to the t-test\n\n\\\n\\\nWe will compare model nested model configurations formed by feature ablation (i.e., full and compact models will differ by features included)\n\\\n\\\nHowever, nothing would be different when implementing these comparison methods if these model configurations different by other characteristics such as statistical algorithm\n\n---\n\n## An Empirical Example of Feature Ablation\n\nThe context for our example will be the Cleveland heart disease dataset\n\\\n\\\nWe will imagine we have developed a new diagnostic screener for heart disease based on an exercise test protocol\n\\\n\\\nWe want to demonstrate the incremental improvement in our screening for heart disease using features from this test vs. other readily available characteristics about the patients\n\n-----\n\nOur exercise test protocol yields four scores ($exer\\_*$) that we use in combination to predict the probability of heart disease in the patient\n\n- Max heart rate during the exercise test\n- Experience of angina during the test\n- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (don't ask me what that is!  ;-)\n- ST depression induced by exercise test relative to rest\n\n\\\n\\\nWe also have many other demographic and physical characteristics that we want to \"control\" for when evaluating the performance of our test\n\n- I use control in both its senses.  It likely helps to have these covariates b/c they reduce error in the outcome\n- I also want to demonstrate that our test has incremental predictive validity above these other characteristics which are already available for screening without my complicated test\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's open the data set and do some basic cleaning\n\n- Note there were some complex issues to deal with\n- Good examples of code to resolve those issues\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_all <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"cleveland.csv\"), col_names = FALSE, \n                     na = \"?\",

This will be a \nsecond use of those folds.  This will lead us to over-estimate the models true \nperformance in new data.

Bayesian estimation has now been included in tidymodels in the `tidyposterior` package using the `perf_mod()` function.  \n\\\n\\\nYou can (and should!) read more about this implementation of Bayesian Estimation in the associated [vignette](https://tidyposterior.tidymodels.org/articles/Getting_Started.html) AND by reading the help materials on `perf_mod()`\n\n-----  \n\nUsing this approach, we will estimate the posterior probability for values associated with specific parameters of interest.

We can then use these posterior probability distributions to determine that probability that the accuracy of the full model is greater than the accuracy of the compact model.  \n\nIn addition, we can also determine if the increased accuracy of the full model is meaningful (i.e., practically important).\n\nTo accomplish this latter goal, we will: \n\n- Specify a Region of Practical Equivalence (a better alternative to the point-wise null in NHST)\n  - I will define classifiers whose performance are within +-1% as equivalent (not meaningfully different from each other) for our example   \n  - Not worth the effort if my test doesn't improve screening accuracy by at least this\n\n----- \n\nTo estimate posterior probabilities for these three parameter estimates, we need to \n\n- set prior probabilities for these parameter estimates.  These should be broad/uninformative in most instances unless you have substantial prior information about credible values.  \n- Collect data on these estimates.  This will be the same as before - the 100 estimates of accuracy using 10x10 fold CV for both the full and compact models.\n\n\\\n\\\nUsing these priors and these data, we can derive the posterior probabilities for our three performance estimates\n\n----- \n\nLets do this step by step.

This handles dependence associated with repeated observations of accuracy using similar models in k-fold cv.\n\n- We are interested in the intercept from this model listed in formula.  The intercept value will represent the accuracy estimate for each model.\n\n- The default for `perf_mod()` will be to constrain the variances of the intercept parameter estimate to be the same across models.  This may be fine for some performance metrics (e.g., rmse) but for binary accuracy the variance is dependent on the mean.  Therefore we allow these variances to be different using `hetero_var = TRUE`\n\n- In some instances (e..g., rmse), we may want to allow the errors in our model to be something other than Gaussian (though this is often a reasonable assumption by the central limit theorem).  You can change the `family` for the errors if needed.  See vignette and help on `perf_mod()`.  Here, we use the default Gaussian distribution.\n\n- This is an iterative process using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method (Hamilton Monte Carlo) so we need to set a seed (for reproducibility), and the number of iterations and chains (beyond the scope of this course to dive into this method).  I provide default values for `iter` and `chains` because you may need to increase these in some instances for the method to converge on valid values.  You can often address converge and other warnings by increasing `iter`, `chains` or `adapt_delta`.

Lets look at them\n\nWe can view the posterior probability distributions using an autoplot method for perf_mod objects. \n\n- These density plots tell how probable various values are for the accuracy of each model\n\n- The probabilities associated with any region of the curve is equal to the area under that curve for that region.

This approach says - if we want to calculate the importance of any specific feature, we can compare our performance metric using the original features to the performance metric we get if we permute (i.e., shuffle) the values for the feature we are evaluating.  \n\\\n\\\nBy randomly shuffling the values for the feature, we break the relationship between that feature and the outcome so it no longer contributes to the predictions.   If performance doesn't change much, then that feature is not important.  If performance goes down a lot, the feature is important.  \n\n- The function can provide `raw` performance (will give us performance for the non-permuted model and then performance for the model with each feature permuted, one at a time) \n- `difference` performance measure, which is the difference between the permuted model and the non-permuted mode, separately for each feature\n- `ratio` performance measure, which is ($\\frac{permuted}{original}$), separately for each feature\n\n-----\n\nTo calculate accuracy after permuting each feature, we use `model_parts()`.

It may also help us visualize and understand if interactions between features exist (if we make a PD plot for two target features).  \n\n-----\n\nThe PD Plot is attractive because \n\n- it is easy to understand (prediction for each feature value averaged across observed values for all other features)\n- if the target feature is uncorrelated with all other features, its interpretation is clear, it is how the average prediction changes as the target features changes values.\n- it is computationally easy to implement\n- it has a causal (for the model, not the real world!) interpretation. This is what happens to the predciction if we manipulate the values of the target feature but hold all other features constant at their observed values.\n\n-----\n\nHowever:\n\n- The assumption that the target feature is not correlated with the other features is likely unrealistic in many/most instances\n- This plot (but also other plot methods) are limited to 1 - 2 features in combination.\n- It may hide effects when interactions exist\n\n-----\n\n### Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plots\n\nIf the features are correlated, the partial dependence plot should not be used because the plots will otherwise be based on combinations of the target feature and other features that may never occur (given the feature correlations).\n\\\n\\\nMolnar describes how this problem of correlated features and unrealistic combinations of features can be solved by M-Plots that plot the average effect of a target feature using the conditional values on other features (i.e., only using realistic values for the other features based on their correlations with the target feature).  Unfortunately, this too is sub-optimal because it will confound the effect of the target feature with the effects of the other features that are correlated with it.\n\n-----\n\nAccumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots also use conditional values of other features to solve the correlated features problem.  However, ALE plots solve the confounding problem by calculating **differences** in predictions associated with changes in the target feature rather than average predictions for each value of that target feature. These differences hold the other features values (mostly) constant to remove their effects.  \n\\\n\\\nALE plots are the preferred plot in situations where  you expect your target feature to be correlated with other features (which is likely most situations.)\n\n-----\n\nWe will use the `DALEX` package again to make these PD and ALE plots.\n\\\n\\\nIt will require the explainer object we created earlier for feature importance\n\\\n\\\nOtherwise, the code is very straight-forward.  Here we get the predicted values for an ALE plot to examine the effect of one of the features from our exercise test (`exer_max_hr`) on disease probabilities. \n\nIf we wanted a PD plot, we could simply substitute `partial` for `accumulated`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nale <- model_profile(explainer = explain_full,\n                     type = \"accumulated\",\n                     variables = \"exer_max_hr\",\n                     N = NULL)  # to use full sample (default is 100)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is a default plot function for these plot object (or you could use the data in the object to make your own ggplot)\n\\\n\\\nThe probability of disease decreases as max hr increases in the exercise test\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nale |> plot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](011_explanation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n## Summary and Closing Thoughts\n\nWhen pursuing purely explanatory goals with machine learning methods, we can: \n\n- Use resampling with the full dataset to determine appropriate model configuration\n  - Best statistical algorithm\n  - Which covariates\n  - Other \"researcher degrees of freedom\" such as handling of outliers, transformations of predictors\n\n- Use model comparisons (Frequentist or Bayesian) in combination with feature ablation to test effect of feature or set of features\n\n- We can use feature importance measures (permutation or Shapley) to understand the contributions that various features make to prediction for an observation (local) or across observations (global)\n\n- We can explore the shape (and magnitude?) of relationships using PD and ALE plots\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Annoucements\n\n- Review conceptual exam\n- RMD files\n\n\n### Questions\n\n#### ALE and PD plots\n- What is the difference between PD plot and ALE plot? And when should we use they for specific?\n\n- I am still confused about partial dependence plots and ale plots and when we want to use them. \n\n- I am confused about the question in the unit 9 quiz. when you have moderate or stronger correlations among your features, ALE and M-plots both could be used to visualize the effects of your features on the outcome. Based on the web book, we learned that M-plot is sub-optimal, which means we better use ALE right? and M-plots are not recommended. \n\n#### Prediction vs. explanation\n- I think it would be useful to talk about how to use these same models that we have been building for explanatory purposes rather than predictive ones. Is that when interpretability matters most? I feel like some of the reading on interpretability contradicted what we talked about earlier on in the semester about how in a predictive model, interpretability doesn't necessarily matter.\n\n- It seems that there is a trade-off regarding interpretability. How to make a good decision about the degree of the interpretability so that the system will be not manipulated when there is a misalignment/mismatch between the goals of the creator and the user? \n\n- If I understood correctly, interpretability/explainability is about the model predictions, while comprehensibility is about users' understanding of the explanations. Transparency is about the algorithms. These concepts are kind of confusing. It would be nice if you could help us distinguish them more conceptually. \n\n#### Permutation test\n\n- Mathematically, is there not a way to estimate what the accuracy would be even if there were not a relationship between predictors and outcome? Wouldn't the estimated accuracy simply be the proportion of observations in the dominant class? I guess I do not see why the permutation test is necessary, then.\n\n- shuffling a feature's values removes the relationship between that feature and the outcome, and I think the prediction error of the model increases. \n\n#### Bayesian estimation\n\n- In case of unit 9, K-fold is preferred, the question goes how to balance the choice between K-fold and bootstrap?\n\n- What's are prior posterior probabilities?\n\n- HDI and ROPE.\n\n- I'm still a little confused about HDI values. I understand that when HDI values are above the ROPE it tells us that our full model is meaningfully better than our compact model, but I don't understand what the HDI values themselves represent or how they are calculated.\n\n- If there’s no difference between our model’s performance and the performance of a similar model in a permuted dataset, (how) can we distinguish whether that’s because there’s no signal in our predictors or because our model failed to exploit that signal?\n\n- I am especially confused about Bayesian estimation for model comparisons. Does convergence mean that the best parameters for the model have been found, and why do we do this specifically with Bayesian estimation\n\n#### Shapley values\n\n- I think I just need a deep dive into shapely values\n\n- What are shapley values and how do we interpret them?\n\n- Revisiting Shapley values\n\n- Since Shapley values average across all possible coalitions, do they implicitly take into account interactions?\n",
