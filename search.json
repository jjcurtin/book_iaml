    "text": "Instructor\nJohn Curtin\n\nOffice hours: Thursdays, 3-4 pm or by appointment in Brogden 326\nEmail: jjcurtin@wisc.edu (but please use Slack DM or channel posts for all course communications during this semester)\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistants\nZihan Li\n\nOffice hours: Mondays, 12:30 - 1:30 pm in Brogden 617 or by appointment\nEmail: zli2545@wisc.edu\n\nCoco Yu\n\nOffice hours: Wednesday, 11 - 12 pm in Brodgen 325 or by appointment\nEmail: jyu274@wisc.edu\n\n\n\nCourse Website\nhttps://jjcurtin.github.io/book_iaml/\n\n\nCommunications\nAll course communications will occur in the course’s Slack workspace (https://iaml-2025.slack.com/). You should have received an invitation to join the workspace. If you have difficulty joining, please contact me by my email above. The TAs and I will respond to all Slack messages within 1 business day (and often much quicker). Please plan accordingly (e.g., weekend messages may not receive a response until Monday). For general questions about class, coding assignments, etc., please post the question to the appropriate public channel. If you have the question, you are probably not alone. For issues relevant only to you (e.g., class absences, accommodations, etc.), you can send a direct message in Slack to me. However, I may share the DM with the TAs unless you request otherwise. In general, we prefer that all course communication occur within Slack rather than by email so that it is centralized in one location.\n\n\nMeeting Times\nThe scheduled course meeting times are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 - 12:15 pm. Tuesdays are generally used by the TAs for lab to discuss application issues from the homework or in the course more generally. Thursdays are generally led by John and used to discuss topics from the video lectures and readings.\nAll required videos, readings, and application assignments are described on the course website at the beginning of each unit.\n\n\nCourse Description\nThis course is designed to introduce students to a variety of computational approaches in machine learning. The course is designed with two key foci. First, students will focus on the application of common, “out-of-the-box” statistical learning algorithms that have good performance and are implemented in tidymodels in R. Second, students will focus on the application of these approaches in the context of common questions in behavioral science in academia and industry.\n\n\nRequisites\nStudents are required to have completed Psychology 610 with a grade of B or better or a comparable course with my consent.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nStudents will develop and refine best practices for data wrangling, general programming, and analysis in R.\nStudents will distinguish among a variety of machine learning settings: supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning, regression vs. classification\nStudents will be able to implement a broad toolbox of well-supported machine-learning methods: decision trees, nearest neighbor, general and generalized linear models, penalized models including ridge, lasso, and elastic-nets, neural nets, random forests.\nStudents will develop expertise with common feature extraction techniques for quantitative and categorical predictors.\nStudents will be able to use natural language processing approaches to extract meaningful features from text data.\nStudents will know how to characterize how well their regression and classification models perform and they will employ appropriate methodology for evaluating their: cross validation, ROC and PR curves, hypothesis testing.\nStudents will learn to apply their skills to common learning problems in psychology and behavioral sciences more generally.\n\n\n\nCourse Topics\n\nOverview of Machine Learning Concepts and Uses\nData wrangling in R using tidyverse and tidymodels\nIterations, functions, simulations in R\nRegression models\nClassification models\nModel performance metrics\nROCs\nCross validation and other resampling methods\nModel selection and regularization\nApproaches to parallel processing\nFeature engineering techniques\nNatural language processing\nTree based methods\nBagging and boosting\nNeural networks\nDimensionality reduction and feature selection\nExplanatory methods including variable importance, partial dependence plots, etc\nEthics and privacy issues\n\n\n\nSchedule\nThe course is organized around 14 weeks of academic instruction covering the following topics:\n\nIntroduction to course and machine learning\nExploratory data analysis\nRegression models\nClassification models\nResampling methods for model selection and evaluation\nRegularization and penalized models\nMidterm exam/project\nAdvanced performance metrics\nModel comparisons\nAdvanced models: Random forests and ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, stacking)\nAdvanced models: Neural networks\nNatural Language Processing I: Text processing and feature engineering\nApplications\nEthics\n\n\nThe final exam is during exam week on Tuesday May 6th from 11 - 12:15 in our normal classroom.\nThe final project is due during exam week on Friday May 9th at 8 pm.\n\n\n\nRequired Textbooks and Software\nAll required textbooks are freely available online (though hard copies can also be purchased if desired). There are eight required textbooks for the course. The primary text for which we will read many chapters is:\n\nJames, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R (2023; 2nd Edition). (website)\n\nWe will also read sections to chapters in each of the following texts:\n\nWickham, H. & Grolemund, G. R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data (1st ed.). Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media, Inc. (website)\nHvitfeldt, E. & Silge, J.

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.\n\n\nGrading\n\nQuizzes (13 anticipated): 15%\nApplication assignments (11 anticipated): 25%\nMidterm application exam: 15%\nMidterm conceptual exam: 15%\nFinal application exam: 15%\nFinal conceptual exam: 15%\n\nFinal letter grades may be curved upward, but a minimum guarantee is made of an A for 93 or above, AB for 88 - 92, B for 83 - 87, BC for 78 - 82, C for 70 - 77, D for 60-69, and F for &lt; 60.\n\n\nExams, Application Assignments and Quizzes\n\nThe midterm application exam will be due during the 7th week of the course on Wednesday, March 5th at 8 pm.\nThe midterm conceptual exam will be administered during class on Thursday, March 6th.\nThe final exam is during exam week on Tuesday May 6th from 11 - 12:15 in our normal classroom.\nThe final project is due during exam week on Friday May 9th at 8 pm.\nApproximately weekly quizzes will be administered through Canvas and due each Wednesday at 8 pm\nApproximately weekly application assignments will be submitted via Canvas and due each Wednesday at 8 pm.\n\n\n\nApplication Assignments\nThe approximately weekly application assignments are due on Wednesdays at 8 pm through Canvas. These assignments are to be done individually. Please do not share answers or code. You are also encouraged to make use of online resources (e.g., stack overflow) for assistance. All assignments will be completed using R markdown to provide both the code and documentation as might be provided to your mentor or employer to fully describe your solution. Late assignments are not accepted because problem solutions are provided immediately after the due date. Application assignments are graded on a three-point scale (0 = not completed, 1 = partially completed and/or with many errors, 2 = fully completed and at least mostly correct). Grades for each assignment will be posted by the following Monday at the latest.\n\n\nChatGPT\nI suspect you have all seen discussions of all that ChatGPT can do by now and its impact on teaching and assessment. I believe that AI like ChatGPT will eventually become an incredible tool for data scientists and programmers. As such, I view these advances with excitement. Of course, I don’t plan to assign a grade to ChatGPT so I want to make sure that we are clear on when you can and when you cannot use it. Given that I expect AI like ChatGPT to become a useful tool in our workflow as professionals, now is the time to start to learn how it can help. Therefore, you are free to use it during any of our application assignments AND the application questions on the mid-term and final exams. Code from ChatGPT is unlikely to be sufficient in either context (and my testing suggests it can be flat out wrong in some instances!) but I suspect that it will still be useful. In contrast, you CANNOT use ChatGPT to answer the conceptual questions on the two exams or the weekly quizzes. Those questions are designed to assess your working knowledge about concepts and best practices. That information must be in YOUR head and I want to be 100% clear that use of ChatGPT to answer those questions will be considered cheating and handled as such if detected. There will be a zero tolerance policy for such cheating. It will be reported to the Dean of Students on first offense.\n\n\nStudent Ethics\nThe members of the faculty of the Department of Psychology at UW-Madison uphold the highest ethical standards of teaching and research. They expect their students to uphold the same standards of ethical conduct. By registering for this course, you are implicitly agreeing to conduct yourself with the utmost integrity throughout the semester.\nIn the Department of Psychology, acts of academic misconduct are taken very seriously. Such acts diminish the educational experience for all involved – students who commit the acts, classmates who would never consider engaging in such behaviors, and instructors. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, cheating on assignments and exams, stealing exams, sabotaging the work of classmates, submitting fraudulent data, plagiarizing the work of classmates or published and/or online sources, acquiring previously written papers and submitting them (altered or unaltered) for course assignments, collaborating with classmates when such collaboration is not authorized, and assisting fellow students in acts of misconduct. Students who have knowledge that classmates have engaged in academic misconduct should report this to the instructor.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nInstitutional statement on diversity: “Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.” https://diversity.wisc.edu/\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nBy enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UW-Madison’s community of scholars in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest academic integrity standards. Academic misconduct compromises the integrity of the university. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these acts are examples of academic misconduct, which can result in disciplinary action. This includes but is not limited to failure on the assignment/course, disciplinary probation, or suspension. Substantial or repeated cases of misconduct will be forwarded to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for additional review. For more information, refer to http://studentconduct.wiscweb.wisc.edu/academic-integrity\n\n\nAccommodations Polices\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center syllabus statement: “The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty [me] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty [I], will work either directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student’s educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.” http://mcburney.wisc.edu/facstaffother/faculty/syllabus.php\nUW-Madison students who have experienced sexual misconduct (which can include sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and/or stalking) also have the right to request academic accommodations. This right is afforded them under Federal legislation (Title IX). Information about services and resources (including information about how to request accommodations) is available through Survivor Services, a part of University Health Services: https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/survivor-services/\n\n\nComplaints\nOccasionally, a student may have a complaint about a TA or course instructor. If that happens, you should feel free to discuss the matter directly with the TA or instructor. If the complaint is about the TA and you do not feel comfortable discussing it with the individual, you should discuss it with the course instructor. Complaints about mistakes in grading should be resolved with the TA and/or instructor in the great majority of cases. If the complaint is about the instructor (other than ordinary grading questions) and you do not feel comfortable discussing it with the individual, make an appointment to speak to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies, Professor Shawn Green, cshawngreen@wisc.edu.\nIf you have concerns about climate or bias in this class, or if you wish to report an incident of bias or hate that has occurred in class, you may contact the Chair of the Department, Professor Allyson Bennett (allyson.j.bennett@wisc.edu) or the Chair of the Psychology Department Climate & Diversity Committee, Martha Alibali (martha.alibali@wisc.edu). You may also use the University’s bias incident reporting system\n\n\nPrivacy of Student Information & Digital Tools\nThe privacy and security of faculty, staff and students’ personal information is a top priority for UW-Madison. The university carefully reviews and vets all campus-supported digital tools used to support teaching and learning, to help support success through learning analytics, and to enable proctoring capabilities. UW-Madison takes necessary steps to ensure that the providers of such tools prioritize proper handling of sensitive data in alignment with FERPA, industry standards and best practices.\nUnder the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA which protects the privacy of student education records), student consent is not required for the university to share with school officials those student education records necessary for carrying out those university functions in which they have legitimate educational interest. 34 CFR 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B). FERPA specifically allows universities to designate vendors such as digital tool providers as school officials, and accordingly to share with them personally identifiable information from student education records if they perform appropriate services for the university and are subject to all applicable requirements governing the use, disclosure and protection of student data.\n\n\nPrivacy of Student Records & the Use of Audio Recorded Lectures\nSee information about privacy of student records and the usage of audio-recorded lectures.\nLecture materials and recordings for this course are protected intellectual property at UW-Madison. Students in this course may use the materials and recordings for their personal use related to participation in this class. Students may also take notes solely for their personal use. If a lecture is not already recorded, you are not authorized to record my lectures without my permission unless you are considered by the university to be a qualified student with a disability requiring accommodation. [Regent Policy Document 4-1] Students may not copy or have lecture materials and recordings outside of class, including posting on internet sites or selling to commercial entities. Students are also prohibited from providing or selling their personal notes to anyone else or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the instructor’s express written permission. Unauthorized use of these copyrighted lecture materials and recordings constitutes copyright infringement and may be addressed under the university’s policies, UWS Chapters 14 and 17, governing student academic and non-academic misconduct.\n\n\nAcademic Calendar & Religious Observances\nStudents who wish to inquire about religious observance accommodations for exams or assignments should contact the instructor within the first two weeks of class, following the university’s policy on religious observance conflicts",

    "text": "1.3 More Details on Supervised Techniques\nFor supervised machine learning problems, we assume \\(Y\\) (outcome) is a function of some data generating process (DGP, \\(f\\)) involving a set of Xs (features) plus the addition of random error (\\(\\epsilon\\)) that is independent of X and with mean of 0\n\\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\)\n\nTerminology sidebar: Throughout the course we will distinguish between the raw predictors available in a dataset and the features that are derived from those raw predictors through various transformations.\n\nWe estimate \\(f\\) (the DGP) for two main reasons: prediction and/or inference (i.e., explanation per Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017)\n\\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\)\nFor prediction, we are most interested in the accuracy of \\(\\hat{Y}\\) and typically treat \\(\\hat{f}\\) as a black box\nFor inference, we are typically interested in the way that \\(Y\\) is affected by \\(X\\)\n\nWhich predictors are associated with \\(Y\\)?\nWhich are the strongest/most important predictors of \\(Y\\)\nWhat is the relationship between the outcome and the features associated with each predictor. Is the overall relationship between a predictor and \\(Y\\) positive, negative, dependent on other predictors? What is the shape of relationship (e.g., linear or more complex)?\nDoes the model as a whole improve prediction beyond a null model (no features from predictors) or beyond a compact model?\nWe care about good (low error) predictions even when we care about inference (we want small \\(\\epsilon\\))\n\nThey will also be tested with low power\nParameter estimates from models that don’t predict well may be incorrect or at least imprecise\n\n\n\nModel error includes both reducible and irreducible error.\nIf we consider both \\(X\\) and \\(\\hat{f}\\) to be fixed, then:\n\n\\(E(Y - \\hat{Y})^2 = (f(X) + \\epsilon - \\hat{f}(X))^2\\)\n\\(E(Y - \\hat{Y})^2 = [f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2 + Var(\\epsilon)\\)\n\n\\(Var(\\epsilon)\\) is irreducible\n\nIrreducible error results from other important \\(X\\) that we fail to measure and from measurement error in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nIrreducible error serves as an (unknown) bounds for model accuracy (without collecting additional Xs)\n\n\\([f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2\\) is reducible\n\nReducible error results from a mismatch between \\(\\hat{f}\\) and the true \\(f\\)\nThis course will focus on techniques to estimate \\(f\\) with the goal of minimizing reducible error\n\n\n\n1.3.1 How Do We Estimate \\(f\\)?\n\nWe need a sample of \\(N\\) observations of \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) that we will call our training set\nThere are two types of statistical algorithms that we can use for \\(\\hat{f}\\):\n\nParametric algorithms\nNon-parametric algorithms\n\n\n\nParametric algorithms:\n\nFirst, make an assumption about the functional form or shape of \\(f\\).\n\nFor example, the general linear model assumes: \\(f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X2 + ... + \\beta_p*X_p\\)\nNext, a model using that algorithm is fit to the training set. In other words, the parameter estimates (e.g., \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1\\)) are derived to minimize some cost function (e.g., mean squared error for the linear model)\nParametric algorithms reduce the problem of estimating \\(f\\) down to one of only estimating some set of parameters for a chosen model\nParametric algorithms often yield more interpretable models\nBut they are often not very flexible. If you chose the wrong algorithm (shape for \\(\\hat{f}\\) that does not match \\(f\\)) the model will not fit well in the training set (and more importantly not in the new test set either)\n\nTerminology sidebar: A training set is a subset of your full dataset that is used to fit a model. In contrast, a validation set is a subset that has not been included in the training set and is used to select a best model from among competing model configurations. A test set is a third subset of the full dataset that has not been included in either the training or validation sets and is used for evaluating the performance of your fitted final/best model.\n\nNon-parametric algorithms:\n\nDo not make any assumption about the form/shape of \\(f\\)\nCan fit well for a wide variety of forms/shapes for \\(f\\)\nThis flexibility comes with costs\n\nThey generally require larger \\(N\\) in the training set than parametric algorithms to achieve comparable performance\nThey may overfit the training set. This happens when they begin to fit the noise in the training set. This will yield low error in training set but much higher error in new validation or test sets.\nThey are often less interpretable\n\n\n\nGenerally:\n\nFlexibility and interpretability are inversely related\nModels need to be flexible enough to fit \\(f\\) well\nAdditional flexibility beyond this can produce overfitting\nParametric algorithms are generally less flexible than non-parametric algorithms\nParametric algorithms can become more flexible by increasing the number of features (\\(p\\) from 610/710; e.g., using more predictors, more complex, non-linear forms to when deriving features from predictors)\nParametric algorithms can be made less flexible through regularization. There are techniques to make some non-parametric algorithms less flexible as well\nYou want the sweet spot for prediction. You may want even less flexible for inference in increase interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 How Do We Assess Model Performance?\nThere is no universally best statistical algorithm\n\nDepends on the true \\(f\\) and your goal (prediction or inference)\nWe often compare multiple statistical algorithms (various parametric and non-parametric options) and model configurations more generally (combinations of different algorithms with different sets of features)\nWhen comparing models/configurations, we need to both fit these models and then select the best one\n\n\nBest needs to be defined with respect to some performance metric in new (validation or test set) data\n\nThere are many performance metrics you might use\nRoot Mean squared error (RMSE) is common for regression problems\nAccuracy is common for classification problems\n\nWe will learn many other performance metrics in a later unit\n\nTwo types of performance problems are typical\n\nModels are underfit if they don’t adequately represent the true \\(f\\), typically because they have oversimplied the relationship (e.g., linear function fit to quadratic DGP, missing key interaction terms)\n\nUnderfit models will yield biased predictions. In other words, they will systematically either under-predict or over-predict \\(Y\\) in some regions of the function.\nBiased models will perform poorly in both training and test sets\n\nModels are overfit if they are too flexible and begin to fit the noise in the training set.\n\nOverfit models will perform well (too well actually) in the training set but poorly in test or validation sets\nThey will show high variance such that the model and its predictions change drastically depending on the training set where it is fit\n\n\n\nMore generally, these problems and their consequences for model performance are largely inversely related\n\nThis is known as the Bias-Variance trade-off\nWe previously discussed reducible and irreducible error\n\nReducible error can be parsed into components due to bias and variance\nGoal is to minimize the sum of bias and variance error (i.e., the reducible error overall)\nWe will often trade off a little bias if it provides a big reduction in variance\n\n\nBut before we dive further into the Bias-Variance trade-off, lets review some key terminology that we will use throughout this course.",

    "section": "1.4 Key Terminology in Context",
    "text": "1.4 Key Terminology in Context\nIn the following pages:\n\nWe will present the broad steps for developing and evaluating machine learning models\nWe will situate key terms in this context (along with other synonymous terms used by others) and highlight them in bold.\n\nMachine learning has emerged in parallel from developments in statistics and computer science.\n\nAs a result, there is a lot of terminology and often multiple terms used for the same concept. This is not my fault!\n\nI will try to use one set of terms, but you need to be familiar with other terms you will encounter\n\n\nWhen developing a supervised machine learning model to predict or explain an outcome (also called DV, label, output):\n\nOur goal is for the model to match as close as possible (given the limits due to irreducible error) the true data generating process for Y.\nWe typically consider multiple (often many) candidate model configurations to achieve this goal.\n\n\nCandidate model configurations can vary with respect to:\n\nthe statistical algorithm used\nthe algorithm’s hyperparameters\nthe features used in the model to predict the outcome\n\n\nStatistical algorithms can be coarsely categorized as parametric or non-parametric.\nBut we will mostly focus on a more granular description of the specific algorithm itself\nExamples of specific statistical algorithms we will learn in this course include the linear model, generalized linear model, elastic net, LASSO, ridge regression, neural networks, KNN, random forest.\n\nThe set of candidate model configurations often includes variations of the same statistical algorithm with different hyperparameter (also called tuning parameter) values that control aspects of the algorithm’s operation.\n\nExamples include \\(k\\) in the KNN algorithm and \\(lambda\\) in LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net algorithms.\nWe will learn more about hyperparameters and their effects later in this course.\n\n\nThe set of candidate model configurations can vary with respect to the features that are included.\n\nA recipe describes how to transform raw data for predictors (also called IVs) into features (also called regressors, inputs) that are included in the feature matrix (also called design matrix, model matrix).\n\nThis process of transforming predictors into features in a feature matrix is called feature engineering.\n\n\nCrossing variation on statistical algorithms, hyperparameter values, and alternative sets of features can increase the number of candidate model configurations dramatically\n\ndeveloping a machine learning model can easily involve fitting thousands of model configurations.\nIn most implementations of machine learning, the number of candidate model configurations nearly ensures that some fitted models will overfit the dataset in which they are developed such that they capitalize on noise that is unique to the dataset in which they were fit.\n\nFor this reason, model configurations are assessed and selected on the basis of their relative performance for new data (observations that were not involved in the fitting process).\n\n\nWe have ONE full dataset but we use resampling techniques to form subsets of that dataset to enable us to assess models’ performance in new data.\nCross-validation and bootstrapping are both examples of classes of resampling techniques that we will learn in this course.\nBroadly, resampling techniques create multiple subsets that consist of random samples of the full dataset. These different subsets can be used for model fitting, model selection, and model evaluation.\n\nTraining sets are subsets that are used for model fitting (also called model training). During model fitting, models with each candidate model configuration are fit to the data in the training set. For example, during fitting, model parameters are estimated for regression algorithms, and weights are established for neural network algorithms. Some non-parametric algorithms, like k-nearest neighbors, do not estimate parameters but simply “memorize” the training sets for subsequent predictions.\nValidation sets are subsets that are used for model selection (or, more accurately, for model configuration selection). During model selection, each (fitted) model — one for every candidate model configuration — is used to make predictions for observations in a validation set that, importantly, does not overlap with the model’s training set. On the basis of each model’s performance in the validation set, the relatively best model configuration (i.e., the configuration of the model that performs best relative to all other model configurations) is identified and selected. If you have only one model configuration, validation set(s) are not needed because there is no need to select among model configurations.\nTest sets are subsets that are used for model evaluation. Generally, a model with the previously identified best configuration is re-fit to all available data other than the test set. This fitted model is used to predict observations in the test set to estimate how well this model is expected to perform for new observations.\n\n\nThere are three broad steps to develop and evaluate a machine learning model:\n\nFitting models with multiple candidate model configurations (in training set(s))\nAssessing each model to select the best configuration (in validation set(s))\nEvaluating how well a model with that best configuration will perform with new observations (in test sets(s))",

    "text": "1.5 An Example of the Bias-Variance Trade-off\n\n1.5.1 Overview of Example\nThe concepts of underfitting vs. overfitting and the bias-variance trade-off are critical to understand\n\nIt is also important to understand how model flexibility can affect both the bias and variance of that model’s performance\nIt can help to make these abstract concepts concrete by exploring real models that are fit in actual data\nWe will conduct a very simple simulation to demonstrate these concepts\n\nThe code in this example is secondary to understanding the concepts of underfittinng, overfitting, bias, variance, and the bias-variance trade-off\n\nWe will not display much of it so that you can maintain focus on the concepts\nYou will have plenty of time to learn the underlying\n\n\nWhen modeling, our goal is typically to approximate the data generating process (DGP) as close as possible, but in the real world we never know the true DGP.\nA key advantage of many simulations is that we do know the DGP because we define it ourselves.\n\nFor example, in this simulation, we know that \\(Y\\) is a cubic function of \\(X\\) and noise (random error).\nIn fact, we know the exact equation for calculating \\(Y\\) as a function of \\(X\\).\n\n\\(y = 1100 - 4.0 * x - 0.4 * x^2 + 0.1 * (x - h)^3 + noise\\), where:\n\nb0 = 1100\nb1 = -4.0\nb2 = -0.4\nb3 = 0.1\nh = -20.0\nnoise has mean = 0 and sd = 150\n\n\n\nWe will attempt to model this cubic DGP with three different model configurations\n\nA simple linear model that uses only \\(X\\) as a feature\nA (20th order) polynomial linear model that uses 20 polynomials of \\(X\\) as features\nA (20th order) polynomial LASSO model that uses the same 20 polynomials of \\(X\\) as features but “regularizes” to remove unimportant features from the model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: If the DGP for y is a cubic function of x, what do we know about the expected bias for our three candidate model configurations in this example?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple linear model will underfit the true DGP and therefore it will be biased b/c it can only represent Y as a linear function of X.\nThe two polynomial models will be generally unbiased b/c they have X represented with 20th order polynomials.\nLASSO will be slightly biased due to regularization but more on that in a later unit.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Stimulation Steps\nWith that introduction complete, lets start our simulation of the bias-variance trade-off\n\nLets simulate four separate research teams, each working to estimate the DGP for Y\n\n\nEach team will get their own random sample of training data (N = 100) to fit models\n\nHere are plots of these four simulated training sets (one for each team) with a dotted line for the data generating process (DGP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get one more large random sample (N = 5000) with the same DGP to use as a test set to evaluate all the models that will be fit in the separate training sets across the four teams.\n\n\nWe will let each team use this same test set to keep things simple\nThe key is that the test set contains new observations not present in any of the training sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the four teams fit their three model configurations in their training sets\nThey use the resulting models to make predictions for observations in the same training set in which they were fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you see evidence of bias for any model configuration? Look in any training set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple linear model is clearly biased. It systemically underestimates Y in some portions of the X distribution and overestimates Y in other portions of the X distribution. This is true across training sets for all teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you see any evidence of overfitting for any model configuration?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe polynomial linear model appears to overfit the data in the training set. In other words, it seems to follow both the signal/DGP and the noise. However, in practice none of the teams could not be certain of this with only their training set.\nIt is possible that the wiggles in the prediction line represent the real DGP. They need to look at the model’s performance in the test set to be certain about the degree of overfitting. (Of course, we know because these are simulated data and we know the DGP.)\n\n\n\n\nNow the teams use their 3 trained models to make predictions for new observations in the test set\n\n\nRemember that the test set has NEW observations of X and Y that weren’t used for fitting any of the models.\nLets look at each model configuration’s performance in test separately\n\n\n\nHere are predictions from the four simple linear models (fit in the training sets for each team) in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you see evidence of bias for the simple linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, consistent with what we saw in the training sets, the simple linear model systematically overestimates Y in some places and underestimates it in others. The DGP is clearly NOT linear but this simple model can only make linear predictions. It is a fairly biased model that underfits the true DGP. This bias will make a large contribution to the reducible error of the model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How much variance across the simple linear models is present?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not much variance in the prediction lines across the models that were fit by different teams in different training sets. The slopes are very close across the different team’s models and the intercepts only vary by a small amount. The simple linear model configuration does not appear to have high variance (across teams) and therefore model variance will not contribute much to its reducible error.\n\n\n\n\nHere are predictions from the polynomial linear models from the four teams in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Are these polynomial models systematically biased?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not much systematic bias. The overall function is generally cubic for all four teams - just like the DGP. Bias will not contribute much to the model’s reducible error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does the variance of these polynomial models compare to the variance of the simple linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is much higher model variance for this polynomial linear model relative to the simple linear model. Although all four models generally predict Y as a cubic function of X, there is also a non-systematic wiggle that is different for each team’s models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does this demonstrate the connection between model overfitting and model variance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel variance (across teams) is a result of overfitting to the training set. If a model fits noise in its training set, that noise will be different in every dataset. Therefore, you end up with different models depending on the training set in which they are fit. And none of those models will do well with new data as you can see in this test set because noise is random and different in each dataset.\n\n\n\n\nHere are predictions from the polynomial LASSO models from each team in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does their bias compare to the simple and polynomial linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LASSO models have low bias much like the polynomial linear model. They are able to capture the true cubic DGP fairly well. The regularization process slightly reduced the magnitude of the cubic (the prediction line is a little straighter than it should be), but not by much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does their variance compare to the simple and polynomial linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll four LASSO models, fit in different training sets, resulted in very similar prediction lines. Therefore, these LASSO models have low variance, much like the simple linear model. In contrast, the LASSO model variance is clearly lower than the more flexible polynomimal model.\n\n\n\n\nNow we will quantify the performance of these models in training and test sets with the root mean square error performance metric. This is the standard deviation of the error when comparing the predicted values for Y to the actual values (ground truth) for Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What do we expect about RMSE for the three models in train and test?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple linear model is underfit to the TRUE DGP. Therfore it is systematically biased everywhere it is used. It won’t fit well in train or test for this reason. However, it’s not very flexible so it won’t be overfit to the noise in train and therefore should fit comparably in train and test.\nThe polynomial linear model will not be biased at all given that the DGP is polynomial.\nHowever, it is overly flexible (20th order) and so will substantially overfit the training data such that it will show high variance and its performance will be poor in test.\nThe polynomial LASSO will be the sweet spot in bias-variance trade-off. It has a little bias but not much. However, it is not as flexible due to regularization by lambda so it won’t be overfit to its training set. Therefore, it should do well in the test set.\n\n\nTo better understand this:\n\nCompare RMSE across the three model configurations within the training sets (turquoise line)\nCompare how RMSE changes for each model configuration across its training set and the test set\nCompare RMSE across the three model configurations within the test set (red line)?\nSpecifically compare the performance of simple linear model (least flexible) with the polynomial linear model (most flexible)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Would these observations about bias and variance of these three model configurations always be the same regardless of the DGP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. A model configuration needs to be flexible enough and/or well designed to represent the DGP for the data that you are modeling. The two polynomial models in this example were each able to represent a cubic DGP. The simple linear model was not. The polynomial linear model was too flexible for a cubic given that it had 20 polynomials of X. Therefore, it was overfit to its training set and had high variance. However, if the DGP was a different shape, the story would be different. If the DGP was linear the simple linear model would not have been biased and would have performed best. If this DGP was some other form (step function), it may be that none of the models would work well.",

    "text": "2.3 Best Practices and Other Recommendations\n\n2.3.1 Data file formats\nWe generally store data as CSV [comma-separated value] files\n\nEasy to view directly in a text editor\nEasy to share because others can use/import into any data analysis platform\nWorks with version control (e.g. git, svn)\nuse read_csv() and write_csv()\n\nExceptions include:\n\nWe may consider binary (.rds) format for very big files because read/write can be slow for csv files.\n\nBinary file format provides a very modest additional protection for sensitive data (which we also don’t share)\nuse read_rds() and write_rds()\n\nSee chapter 7 - Data Import in Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) for more details and advanced techniques for importing data using read_csv()\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Classing Variables\nWe store and class variables in R based on their data type (level of measurement).\n\nSee Wikipedia definitions for levels of measurement for a bit more precision that we will provide here.\n\nCoarsely, there are four levels:\n\nnominal: qualitative categories, no inherent order (e.g., marital status, sex, car color)\nordinal: qualitative categories (sometimes uses number), inherent order but not equidistant spacing (e.g., Likert scale; education level)\ninterval and ratio (generally treated the same in social sciences): quantitative scores, ordered, equidistant spacing. Ratio has true 0. (e.g., temperature in Celsius vs. Kelvin scales)\n\nWe generally refer to nominal and ordinal variables as categorical and interval/ratio as quantitative or numeric\n\nFor nominal variables\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors when we load them (using read_csv())\nIn some cases, we should pay attention to the order of the levels of the variable. e.g.,\n\nFor a dichotomous outcome variable, the positive/event level of dichotomous factor outcome should be first level of the factor\nThe order of levels may also matter for factor predictors (e.g., step_dummy() uses first level as reference).\n\n\n\nFor ordinal variables:\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors (just like nominal variables)\n\nIt is easier to do EDA with these variables classes as factors\nWe use standard factors (not ordered)\n\nConfirm that the order of the levels is set up correctly. This is very important for ordinal variables.\nDuring feature engineering stage, we can then either\n\nTreat as a nominal variable and create features using step_dummy()\nTreat as an interval variable using step_ordinalscore()\n\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both nominal and ordinal variable\nOrdinal variables may show non-linear relations b/c they may not be evenly spaced. In these instances, we can use feature engineering approaches that are also used for nominal variables\n\nFor interval and ratio variables:\n\nWe store these variables as numeric\nWe class these variables as numeric (either integer or double - let R decide) during the read and clean stage (They are typically already in this class when read in)\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both interval and ratio variables\nSimilar feature engineering approaches are used with both\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Data Dictionaries\nYou should always make a data dictionary for use with your data files.\n\nIdeally, these are created during the planning phase of your study, prior to the start of data collection\nStill useful if created at the start of data analysis\n\nData dictionaries:\n\nHelp you keep track of your variables and their characteristics (e.g., valid ranges, valid responses)\nCan be used by you to check your data during EDA\nCan be provided to others when you share your data (data are not generally useful to others without a data dictionary)\n\nWe will see a variety of data dictionaries throughout the course. Many are not great as you will learn.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 The Ames Housing Prices Dataset\nWe will use the Ames Housing Prices dataset as a running example this unit (and some future units and application assignments as well)\n\nYou can read more about the original dataset created by Dean DeCock\nThe data set contains data from home sales of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010\nThe original data set includes 2930 observations of sales price and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous)\nThis is the original data dictionary\nThe challenge with this dataset is to build the best possible prediction model for the sale price of the homes.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Packages and Conflicts\nFirst, lets set up our environment with functions from important packages. I strongly recommend reviewing our recommendations for best practices regarding managing function conflicts now. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future.\n\nWe set a conflicts policy that will produce errors if we have unanticipated conflicts.\nWe source a library of functions that we use for common tasks in machine learning.\n\nThis includes a function (tidymodels_conflictRules()) that sets conflict rules to allow us to attach tidymodels functions without conflicts with tidyverse functions.\n\nYou can review that function to see what it does (search for that function name at the link)\n\nThen we use that function\n\n\n\nCode\noptions(conflicts.policy = \"depends.ok\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true\")\ntidymodels_conflictRules()\n\n\n\nNext we load packages for functions that we will use regularly. There are five things to note RE best practices\n\nIf we will use a lot of functions from a package (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels), we attach the full package\nIf we will use only several functions from a package (but plan to use them repeatedly), we use the include.only parameter to just attach those functions.\nAt times, if we plan to use a single function from a package only 1-2x times, we may not even attach that function at all. Instead, we just call it using its namespace (i.e. packagename::functionname)\nIf a package has a function that conflicts with our primary packages and we don’t plan to use that function, we load the package but exclude the function. If we really needed it, we can call it with its namespace as per option 3 above.\nPay attention to conflicts that were allowed to make sure you understand and accept them. (I left the package messages and warnings in the book this time to see them. I will hide them to avoid cluttering book in later units but you should always review them.)\n\n\n\nCode\n1library(janitor, include.only = \"clean_names\")\n2library(cowplot, include.only = \"plot_grid\")\n3library(kableExtra, exclude = \"group_rows\")\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n4library(tidymodels)\n\n\n\n1\n\nAs an alternative, we could have skipped loading the package and instead called the function as janitor::clean_names()\n\n2\n\nSame is true for cowplot package\n\n3\n\nWhen loading kableExtra (which we use often), you will always need to exclude groups_rows() to prevent a conflict with dplyr package in the tidyverse\n\n4\n\nLoading tidymodels will produce conflicts unless you source and call my function tidymodels_conflictRules() (see above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Source and Other Environment Settings\nWe will also source (from github) two other libraries of functions that we use commonly for exploratory data analyses. You should review these function scripts (fun_eda.R; fun_plots.R to see the code for these functions.\n\n\nCode\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true\")\n\n\n\nFinally, we tune our environment a bit more by setting plot themes and print options that we prefer\n\n\nCode\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\noptions(tibble.width = Inf, tibble.print_max = Inf)\n\n\nAnd we set a relative path to our data. This assumes you are using an RStudio project with the path to the data relative to that project file. I’ve provided more detail elsewhere on best practices for managing files and paths.\n\n\nCode\npath_data &lt;- \"data\"\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Read and Glimpse Dataframe\nLets read in the data and glimpse the subset of observations we will work with in Units 2-3 and the first two application assignments.\n\n\nCode\n1data_all &lt;- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_raw_class.csv\"),\n2                     col_types = cols()) |&gt;\n3  glimpse()\n\n\n\n1\n\nFirst we read data using a relative path and the here::here() function. This is a replacement for file.path() that works better for both interactive use and rendering in Quarto when using projects.\n\n2\n\nWe use col_types = cols() to let R guess the correct class for each column. This suppresses messages that aren’t important at this point prior to EDA.\n\n3\n\nIt is good practice to always glimpse() data after you read it.\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 81\n$ PID               &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Cleaning\nEDA could be done using either tidyverse packages and functions or tidymodels (mostly using the recipes package.)\n\nWe prefer to use the richer set of functions available in the tidyverse (and dplyr and purrr packages in particular).\nWe will reserve the use of recipes for feature engineering only when we are building features for models that we will fit in our training sets and evaluation in our validation and test sets.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Data Leakage Issues\nData leakage refers to a mistake made by the developer of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between their training set and held-out validation or test sets\n\nTraining sets are used to fit models with different configurations\nValidation sets are used to select the best model among those with different configurations (not needed if you only have one configuration)\nTest sets are used to evaluate a best model\nWhen splitting data-sets into training, validation and test sets, the goal is to ensure that no data (or information more broadly) are shared between the three sets\n\nNo data or information from test should influence either fitting or selecting models\nTest should only be used once to evaluate a best/final model\nTrain and validation set also must be segregated (although validation sets may be used to evaluate many model configurations)\nInformation necessary for transformations and other feature engineering (e.g., means/sds for centering/scaling, procedures for missing data imputation) must all be based only on training data.\nData leakage is common if you are not careful.\n\n\nIn particular, if we begin to use test data or information about test during model fitting\n\nWe risk overfitting\nThis is essentially the equivalent of p-hacking in traditional analyses\nOur estimate of model performance will be too optimistic, which could have harmful real-world consequences.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Tidy variable names\nUse snake case for variable names\n\nclean_names() from janitor package is useful for this.\nMay need to do further correction of variable names using rename()\nSee more details about tidy names for objects (e.g., variables, dfs, functions) per Tidy Style Guide\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  clean_names(\"snake\")\n\ndata_all |&gt; names()\n\n\n [1] \"sale_price\"   \"gr_liv_area\"  \"lot_area\"     \"year_built\"   \"overall_qual\"\n [6] \"garage_cars\"  \"garage_qual\"  \"ms_zoning\"    \"lot_config\"   \"bldg_type\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Explore variable classes\nAt this point, we should class all of our variables as either numeric or factor\n\nInterval and ratio variables use numeric classes (dbl or int)\nNominal and ordinal variable use factor class\nUseful for variable selection later (e.g., where(is.numeric), where(is.factor))\n\nSubsequent cleaning steps are clearer if we have this established/confirmed now\n\nWe have a number of nominal or ordinal variables that are classed as character.\nWe have one ordinal variable (overall_qual) that is classed as numeric (because the levels were coded with numbers rather than text)\n\nread_csv() thought was numeric by the levels are coded using numbers\nThe data dictionary indicates that valid values range from 1 - 10.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_all |&gt; glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;chr&gt; \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;chr&gt; \"RL\", \"RH\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL…\n$ lot_config   &lt;chr&gt; \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Inside\", \"Inside…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;chr&gt; \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"TwnhsE\", \"TwnhsE\", \"Twnh…\n\n\n\nWe can the recode overall_qual first and set its levels\nWe can recode all the character variables to factor in one step.

It is not necessary here because overall_qual was numeric and therefore sorts in the expected order. However, if it had been numbers stored as characters, it could sort incorrectly (e.g., 1, 10, 2, 3, …). And obviously if the orders levels were names, the order would have to be specified.\n\n2\n\nWe indicate the levels here.\n\n3\n\nWe use a mutate to re-class all character data to factors. I prefer factor() to forcats::fct() because factor orders the levels alphabetically. Be aware that this could change if your code is used in a region of the world where this sorting is different. I still prefer this to the alternative (in fct()) that orders by the order the levels are found in your data.\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, T…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; RL, RH, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, R…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; Corner, Inside, Corner, Inside, Inside, Inside, Inside, I…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, 1Fam, 1Fa…\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Skimming the data\nskim() from the skimr package is a wonderful and customizable function for summary statistics\n\nIt is highly customizable so we can write our own versions for our own needs\nWe use different versions for cleaning and modeling EDA\nFor cleaning EDA, we just remove some stats that we don’t want to see at this time\nWe can get many of the summary stats for cleaning in one call\nWe have a custom skim defined in the fun_eda.R function library that we use regularly.

dictionary, we see that NA for garage_qual should be coded as “no garage”. We will correct this in our data set.\nThis is a pretty poor choice on the part of the researchers who created the dataset because it becomes impossible to distinguish between NA that means no garage vs. true NA for the variable. In fact, if you later do really careful EDA on the full data set with all variables, you will see this problem likely exists in this dataset\nAnyway, let’s correct all the NA for garage_qual to “no_garage” using mutate()\n\n\nCode\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(garage_qual = fct_expand(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"),\n2         garage_qual = replace_na(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"))\n\n\n\n1\n\nFirst add a new level to the factor\n\n2\n\nThen recode NA to that new level\n\n\n\n\nWe will leave the NA for garage_cars as NA because its not clear if that is truly missing or not, based on further EDA not shown here.\n\nWe have one other issue with garage_qual. It is an ordinal variable but we never reviewed the order of its levels. The data dictionary indicates the levels are ordered (best to worst) as:\n\nEx (excellent)\nGd (good)\nTA (typical/average)\nFa (fair)\nPo (poor)\n\nAnd we might assume that no garage is even worse than a poor garage.

We often use anonymous functions when using the functions from the purrr package (e.g., map(), walk())\nWe use walk() from the purrr package to apply our anonymous function to all columns of the data frame at once\nJust copy this code for now\nWe will see simpler uses later that will help you understand iteration with purrr functions\nSee the chapter on iteration in R for Data Science (2e) for more info on map() and walk()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.8 Tidy Responses for Categorical Variables\nFeature engineering with nominal and ordinal variables typically involves\n\nConverting to factors (already did this!)\nOften creating dummy features from these factors\n\nThis feature engineering will use response labels for naming new features\n\nTherefore, it is a good idea to have the responses snake-cased and cleaned up a bit so that these new feature names are clean/clear.\n\nHere is an easy way to convert responses for character variables to snake case using a function (tidy_responses()) we share in fun_eda.R (reproduced here).\n\nThis uses regular expressions (regex), which will will learn about in a later unit on text processing.\nYou could expand this cleaning function if you encounter other issues that need to be cleaned in the factor levels.\n\n\n\nCode\ntidy_responses &lt;- function(column){\n  # replace all non-alphanumeric with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\W\", \"_\"))\n  # replace whitespace with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\s+\", \"_\"))\n  # replace multiple _ with single _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_+\", \"_\"))\n  #remove _ at end of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_$\", \"\"))\n  # remove _ at start of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\^_\", \"\"))\n  # convert to lowercase\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, tolower)\n  factor(column)\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s use the function\n\n\nCode\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(across(where(is.factor), tidy_responses))\n\n\n\n1\n\nWe use the tidy selection helper function to limit our mutate to only factors. See more details on the tidy selection helpers like all_of() and where()\n\n\n\n\n\nAlas, these response labels were pretty poorly chosen so some didn’t convert well. And some are really hard to understand too.\n\nAvoid this problem and choose good response labels from the start for your own data\nHere, we show you what we got from using tidy_responses()\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_all |&gt; \n  select(where(is.factor)) |&gt;\n  walk(\\(column) print(levels(column)))\n\n\n [1] \"1\"  \"2\"  \"3\"  \"4\"  \"5\"  \"6\"  \"7\"  \"8\"  \"9\"  \"10\"\n[1] \"no_garage\" \"po\"        \"fa\"        \"ta\"        \"gd\"        \"ex\"       \n[1] \"a_agr\" \"c_all\" \"fv\"    \"i_all\" \"rh\"    \"rl\"    \"rm\"   \n[1] \"corner\"  \"culdsac\" \"fr2\"     \"fr3\"     \"inside\" \n[1] \"1fam\"   \"2fmcon\" \"duplex\" \"twnhs\"  \"twnhse\"\n\n\n\nLets clean them up a bit more manually\n\n\nCode\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning = fct_recode(ms_zoning,\n                                res_low = \"rl\",\n                                res_med = \"rm\",\n                                res_high = \"rh\",\n                                float = \"fv\",\n                                agri = \"a_agr\",\n                                indus = \"i_all\",\n                                commer = \"c_all\"),\n1         bldg_type = fct_recode(bldg_type,\n                                one_fam = \"1fam\",\n                                two_fam = \"2fmcon\",\n                                town_end = \"twnhse\",\n                                town_inside = \"twnhs\"))\n\n\n\n1\n\nNote that I did not need to list all levels in the recode. Only the levels I wanted to change.\n\n\n\n\nThe full dataset is now clean!\n\n\n\n2.4.9 Train/Validate/Test Splits\nThe final task we typically do as part of the data preparation process is to split the full dataset into training, validation and test sets.\n\nTest sets are “typically” between 20-30% of your full dataset\n\nThere are costs and benefits to larger test sets\nWe will learn about these costs/benefits in the unit on resampling\nI have already held out the test set\n\nThere are many approaches to validation sets\n\nFor now (until unit 5) we will use a single validation set approach\nWe will use 25% of the remaining data (after holding out the test set) as a validation set for this example\n\nIt is typical to split data on the outcome within strata\n\nFor a categorical outcome, this makes the proportions of the response categories more balanced across the train, validation, and test sets\nFor a numeric outcome, we first break up the distribution into temporary bins (see breaks = 4 below) and then we split within these bins\n\nIMPORTANT: Set a seed so that you can reproduce these splits if you later do more cleaning\n\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(20110522)\nsplits &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  initial_split(prop = 3/4, strata = \"sale_price\", breaks = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding Note\n\n\n\ninitial_split() is used to create two resamples of your data. This was used here because we already had a test set held out (outside of the code presented). We use analysis() and assessment() to extract these two resamples.\nWe will later use initial_validation_split() to create 3 resamples: training, validation, and test. We will extract those three resamples using training(), validation(), and testing()`\n\n\n\nWe then extract the training set from the splits and save it\n\nTraining sets are used for “analysis”- hence the name of the function\n\n\n\nCode\nsplits |&gt; \n1  analysis() |&gt;\n  glimpse() |&gt; \n  write_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"))\n\n\n\n1\n\nanalysis() pulls out the training set from our splits of data_all\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n\n\n\nWe will not need the validation set for modeling EDA\n\nIt should NOT be used for anything other than calculating performance metrics for our many model configurations to select the best model configuration\nWe do NOT do Modeling EDA or Model Fitting with the validation set\nSave it in this clean form for easy use when you need it\nWe use the validation set to “assess” (calculate performance metrics for selection) models that we have fit in training sets - hence the name of the function\n\n\n\nCode\nsplits |&gt; \n1  assessment() |&gt;\n  glimpse() |&gt; \n  write_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_val.csv\"))\n\n\n\n1\n\nassessment() pulls out the validation set from our splits of data_all\n\n\n\n\nRows: 490\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 189900, 189000, 171500, 212000, 164000, 394432, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 1629, 1804, 1341, 1502, 1752, 1856, 1004, 1092, 106…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 13830, 7500, 10176, 6820, 12134, 11394, 11241, 168…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1997, 1999, 1990, 1985, 1988, 2010, 1970, 1971, 197…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 6, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 6, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 8, 7, 8, 6, 5, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, t…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; corner, inside, inside, inside, corner, inside, corner, c…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_end, one_fam, on…",

For example:\n\nTransforming factors into “dummy” features if needed\nLinear and non-linear transformations (e.g., log, box-cox)\nPolynomials and interactions (i.e., x1 * x1 or x1 * x2)\nMissing value imputations\n\nProper use of recipes is an important tool to prevent data leakage between train and either validation or test.\nRecipes use only information from the training set in all feature engineering\nConsider example of standardizing x1 for a feature in train vs. validation and test. Must use mean and sd from TRAIN to standardize x1 in train, validate, and test. VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n\nWe use recipes in a two step process - prep() and bake()\n\n“Prepping” a recipe involves calculating any statistics needed for the transformations that will be applied to engineer features (e.g., mean and standard deviation to normalize a numeric variable).\n\nPrepping is done with the prep() function.\nPrepping is always done only with training data. A “prepped” recipe does not derive any statistics from validation or test sets.\n\n“Baking” is the process of calculating the features\n\nBaking is done with the bake() function.\nWe used our prepped recipe when we bake.\nWhereas we only prep a recipe with training data, we can use a prepped recipe to bake features from any dataset (training, validation, or test).\n\n\n\nWe will work with recipes extensively when model building starting in unit 3\nFor now, we will only use the recipe to indicate roles as a gentle introduction.\nWe will expand on this recipe in unit 3\nRecipe syntax is very similar to generic tidyverse syntax (created by same group)\n\nActually a subset of tidyverse functions\nLess flexible/powerful but focused on our needs and easier to learn\nYou will eventually know both\n\n\nRecipes are used in Modeling scripts (which is a third type of script after cleaning and modeling EDA scripts)\n\nLets reload training again to pretend we are starting a new script\n\n\n\nCode\n data_trn &lt;- read_csv(file.path(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"), \n                      col_types = cols()) |&gt; \n1  class_ames() |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n\n1\n\nRemember our function for classing!\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n\n\n\nRecipes can be used to indicate the outcome and predictors that will be used in the model\n\nCan use . to indicate all predictors\n\nCurrently, our preferred method for larger data sets\nWe can exclude some predictors later by changing their role, removing them with a later recipe step (\\(step\\_rm()\\)), or specifying a more precise formula when we fit the model\nSee Roles in Recipes for more info\n\nCan use specific names of predictors along with \\(+\\)\n\nThis is our preferred method when we have a smaller set of predictors (We will show you both approaches)\ne.g., sale_price ~ lot_area + year_built + overall_qual\n\nDo NOT indicate interactions here\n\nAll predictors are combined with +\nInteractions are specified by a later explicit feature engineering step\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrec &lt;- recipe(sale_price ~ ., data = data_trn)\n\nrec\n\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 9\n\n\nCode\nsummary(rec)\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   variable     type      role      source  \n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;list&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 gr_liv_area  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 2 lot_area     &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 3 year_built   &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 4 overall_qual &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 5 garage_cars  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 6 garage_qual  &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 7 ms_zoning    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 8 lot_config   &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 9 bldg_type    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n10 sale_price   &lt;chr [2]&gt; outcome   original\n\n\n\n\n2.6.1 Prepping and Baking a Recipe\nLet’s make a feature matrix from the training set\nThere are two discrete (and important) steps\n\nprep()\nbake()\n\nFirst we prep the recipe using the training data\n\n\nCode\n1rec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt;\n2  prep(training = data_trn)\n\n\n\n1\n\nWe start by prepping our raw/original recipe (rec)\n\n2\n\nWe use the prep() function on on the training data. Recipes are ALWAYS prepped using training data. This makes sure that are recipes will always only use information from the training set when making features for any subsequent dataset. As part of the prepping process, prep() calculates and saves the features for the training data for later use\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, we bake the training data using this prepped recipe to get a feature matrix from it.\nWe set new_data = NULL because don’t need features for new data. Instead, we want features from the training data that were used to prep the recipe\n\n\nCode\nfeat_trn &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(new_data = NULL)\n\n\n\nFinally, we should generally at least glimpse and/or skim (and typically do some more EDA) on our features to make sure our recipe is doing what we expect.\n\nglimpse\n\n\n\nCode\nfeat_trn |&gt; glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n\n\n\n\nskim\n\n\n\nCode\nfeat_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n10\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nfactor\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\n\noverall_qual\n0\n1\n10\n5: 424, 6: 350, 7: 304, 8: 176\n\n\ngarage_qual\n0\n1\n5\nta: 1312, no_: 81, fa: 57, gd: 13\n\n\nms_zoning\n0\n1\n7\nres: 1157, res: 217, flo: 66, com: 13\n\n\nlot_config\n0\n1\n5\nins: 1095, cor: 248, cul: 81, fr2: 39\n\n\nbldg_type\n0\n1\n5\none: 1216, tow: 108, dup: 63, tow: 46\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n1\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now use our features from training to train models, but that will take place in the next unit!\nWe could also use the prepped recipe to bake validation or test data to evaluate trained models.

    "text": "3.2 ——————————————————————————–\nPause for a moment to answer this question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhy do we need independent validation data to select the best model configuration? In other words, why cant we just fit and evaluate all of the models in our one training set?\n\n\n\nThese models will all overfit the dataset within which they are fit to some degree.\nIn other words, they will predict both systematic variance (the DGP) and some noise in the training set. However, they will differ in how much they overfit the training set.\nAs the models get more flexible they will have the potential to overfit to a greater degree.Models with a larger number of features (e.g., more predictors, features based on interactions as well as raw predictors) will overfit to a greater degree. All other things equal, the non-parametric KNN will also be more flexible than the general linear model so it may overfit to a greater degree as well if the true DGP is linear on the features.\nTherefore, just because a model fits the training set well does not mean it will work well in new data because the noise will be different in every new dataset. This overfitting will be removed from our performance estimate if we calculate it with new data (the validation set).\n\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the available raw predictors in the training set\n\n\nCode\ndata_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ndata_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n10\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nfactor\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\n\noverall_qual\n0\n1\n10\n5: 424, 6: 350, 7: 304, 8: 176\n\n\ngarage_qual\n0\n1\n5\nta: 1312, no_: 81, fa: 57, gd: 13\n\n\nms_zoning\n0\n1\n7\nres: 1157, res: 217, flo: 66, com: 13\n\n\nlot_config\n0\n1\n5\nins: 1095, cor: 248, cul: 81, fr2: 39\n\n\nbldg_type\n0\n1\n5\none: 1216, tow: 108, dup: 63, tow: 46\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n1\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember from our modeling EDA that we have some issues to address as part of our feature engineering:\n\nMissing values\nPossible transformation of sale_price\nPossible transformation of other numeric predictors\nWe will need to use some feature engineering techniques to handle categorical variables\nWe may need to consider interactions among features\n\nAll of this will be accomplished with a recipe\nBut first, let’s discuss/review our first statistical algorithm",

    "text": "3.3 The Simple (General) Linear Model (LM)\nWe will start with only a quick review of the use of the simple (one feature) linear model (LM) as a machine learning model because you should be very familiar with this statistical model at this point\n\n\\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\epsilon\\)\n\nApplied to our regression problem, we might fit a model such as:\n\n\\(sale\\_price = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*gr\\_liv\\_area + \\epsilon\\)\n\nThe (general) linear model is a parametric model. We need to estimate two parameters using our training set\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\)\n\\(\\beta_1\\)\n\nYou already know how to do this using lm() in base R. However, we will use the tidymodels modeling approach.\n\nWe use tidymodels because:\n\nIt provides a consistent interface to many (and growing numbers) of statistical algorithms\nIt provides very strong and easy feature engineering routines (e.g., missing data, scaling, transformations, near-zero variance, collinearity) via recipes\nIt simplifies model performance evaluation using resampling approaches (that you don’t know yet!)\nIt supports numerous performance metrics\nIt is tightly integrated within the tidyverse\nIt is under active development and support\nYou can see documentation for all of the packages at the tidymodels website.

You can reuse this code repeatedly to track your own models if you like. (Perhaps we should write a function??)\n\nFor explanatory purposes, we might want to visualize the relationship between a feature and the outcome (in addition to examining the parameter estimates and the associated statistical tests)\n\nHere is a plot of \\(\\hat{sale\\_price}\\) by gr_liv_area superimposed over a scatterplot of the raw data from the validation set\n\n\n\nCode\nfeat_val |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = gr_liv_area)) +\n    geom_point(aes(y = sale_price), color = \"gray\") +\n    geom_line(aes(y = predict(fit_lm_1, data_val)$.pred), \n              linewidth = 1.25, color = \"blue\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Validation Set\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, there is a moderately strong positive relationship between gr_liv_area and sale_price.\n\nWe can also again see the heteroscadasticity in the errors that might be corrected by a power transformation of sale_price (or gr_liv_area)",

You can see how the unique effect of gr_liv_area is smaller than its overall effect from the simple regression. This also means that the overall predictive strength of the model will not be a sum of the effects of each predictor considered in isolation - it will likely be less.\nAlso, if the correlations are high, problems with multicollinearity will emerge. This will yield large standard errors which means that the models will start to have more variance when fit in different training datasets! We will soon learn about other regularized versions of the GLM that do not have these issues with correlated predictors.\n\n\nHow well does this more complex model perform in validation?

    "text": "3.5 Extension to Categorical Predictors\nMany important predictors in our models may be categorical (nominal and some ordinal predictors)\n\nSome statistical algorithms (e.g., random forest) can accept even nominal predictors as features without any further feature engineering\nBut many cannot. Linear models cannot.\nThe type of feature engineering may differ for nominal vs. ordinal categorical predictors\nFor nominal categorical predictors:\n\nWe need to learn a common approach to transform them to numeric features - dummy coding. We will learn the concept in general AND how to accomplish within a feature engineering recipe.\n\nFor ordinal predictors:\n\nWe can treat them like numeric predictors\nWe can treat them like nominal categorical predictors\n\nSee article on Categorical Predictors on the tidymodels website for more details\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Dummy Coding\nFor many algorithms, we will need to use feature engineering to convert a categorical predictor to numeric features. One common technique is to use dummy coding. When dummy coding a predictor, we transform the original categorical predictor with m levels into m-1 dummy coded features.\nTo better understand how and why we do this, lets consider a version of ms_zoning in the Ames dataset.\n\n\nCode\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; \n  table()\n\n\n\n    agri   commer    float    indus res_high  res_low  res_med \n       2       13       66        1        9     1157      217 \n\n\nWe will recode ms_zoning to have only 3 levels to make our example simple (though dummy codes can be used for predictors with any number of levels)\n\n\nCode\ndata_dummy &lt;- data_trn |&gt; \n1  select(sale_price, ms_zoning)  |&gt;\n2  mutate(ms_zoning3 = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\",\n                                                   \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n3                                 \"floating\" = \"float\")) |&gt;\n4  select(-ms_zoning)\n\n\n\n1\n\nMake a df (dataframe) with only sale_price and ms_zoning\n\n2\n\nfct_collapse() from the forcats package is our preferred way to collapse levels of a factor.

The shape and strength of the relationship between it and sale_price will completely change based on arbitrary ordering of the levels.\n\n\nImagine fitting a straight line to predict sale_price from ms_zoning3 using these three different ways to arbitrarily assign numbers to levels.\n\n\nCode\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 2,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 3)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_dummy |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning3 = case_when(ms_zoning3 == \"residential\" ~ 3,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"commercial\" ~ 1,\n                                ms_zoning3 == \"floating\" ~ 2)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ms_zoning3, y = sale_price)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDummy coding resolves this issue.\n\nWhen using dummy codes, we transform (i.e., feature engineer) our original m-level categorical predictor to m-1 dummy features.\nEach of these m-1 features represents a contrast between a specific level of the categorical variable and a reference level\nThe full set of m-1 features represents the overall effect of the categorical predictor variable.\nWe assign values of 0 or 1 to each observation on each feature in a meaningful pattern (see below)\n\n\nFor example, with our three-level predictor: ms_zoning3\n\nWe need 2 dummmy features (d1, d2) to represent this 3-level categorical predictor\nDummy feature 1 is coded 1 for residential and 0 for all other levels\nDummy feature 2 is coded 1 for floating and 0 for all other levels\n\nHere is this coding scheme displayed in a table\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  ms_zoning3     d1    d2\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 commercial      0     0\n2 residential     1     0\n3 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nWith this coding:\n\nCommercial properties are coded 0 for both d1 and d2.\n\nThis means that commercial properties will become the reference level against which both residential and floating village are compared.\nBecause we are focused on prediction, the choice of reference level is mostly arbitrary. For explanatory goals, you might consider which level is best suited to be the reference.\nThere is much deeper coverage of dummy and other contrast coding in 610/710\n\n\nWe can add these two features manually to the data frame and view a handful of observations to make this coding scheme more concrete\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  sale_price ms_zoning3     d1    d2\n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     105000 residential     1     0\n2     126000 residential     1     0\n3      13100 commercial      0     0\n4     115000 residential     1     0\n5     149500 floating        0     1\n6      40000 commercial      0     0\n7     120000 residential     1     0\n8     151000 floating        0     1\n\n\n\nIf we now fit a model where we predict sale_price from these two dummy coded features, each feature would represent the contrast of the mean sale_price for the level coded 1 vs. the mean sale_price for the level that is coded 0 for all features (i.e., commercial)\n\nd1 is the contrast of mean sale_price for residential vs. commercial\nd2 is the contrast of mean sale_price for floating vs. commercial\nThe combined effect of these two features represents the overall effect of ms_zoning3 on sale_price\n\n\nLets do this quickly in base R using lm() as you have done previously in 610.\n\n\nCode\nm &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ d1 + d2, data = data_dummy) \n\nm |&gt; summary()\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ d1 + d2, data = data_dummy)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-166952  -50241  -20241   31254  565259 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This would also prevent a linear model from fitting (‘dummy variable trap’).\nHowever, some statistical algorithms do not have problems with perfect multicollinearity (e.g., LASSO, ridge regression).\n\nFor these algorithms, you will sometimes see modified version of dummy coding called one-hot coding.\n\nThis approach uses one additional dummy coded feature for the final category.\n\nWe won’t spend time on this but you should be familiar with the term b/c it is often confused with dummy coding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding Sidebar\n\n\n\nWhen creating dummy coded features from factors that have levels with infrequent observations, you may occasionally end up with novel levels in your validation or test sets that were not present in your training set.\n\nThis will cause you issues.\n\nThese issues are mostly resolved if you make sure to explicitly list all possible levels for a factor when classing that factor in the training data, even if the level doesn’t exist in the training data.\n\nWe provide more detail on this issue in an appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Nominal Predictors\nNow that we understand how to use dummy coding to feature engineer nominal predictors, let’s consider some potentially important ones that are available to us.\nWe can discuss if any look promising.\n\nLets return first to ms_zoning\n\n\nCode\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"ms_zoning\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two datapoints have been dropped.\nℹ Set `drop = FALSE` to consider such groups for position adjustment purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might:\n\nRepresent it with 6 dummy features (because there are 7 raw levels) but many of the categories are very low n - won’t account for much variance?\nCombine all the commercial categories (agri, commer, indus), which would take care of most of the low n groups.

We can now do this formally in a recipe so that it can be used in our modeling workflow.\n\nFirst, if you noticed earlier, there are some levels for ms_zoning that are pretty infrequent. Lets make sure both data_trn and data_val have all levels set for this factor.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_trn |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n\n[1] \"agri\"     \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\n\nCode\ndata_val |&gt; pull(ms_zoning) |&gt; levels()\n\n\n[1] \"commer\"   \"float\"    \"indus\"    \"res_high\" \"res_low\"  \"res_med\" \n\n\n\nAs expected, we are missing a level (agri) in data_val. Lets fix that here\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_val &lt;- data_val |&gt; \n  mutate(ms_zoning = factor(ms_zoning, \n                            levels = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"float\", \"indus\", \n                                       \"res_high\", \"res_low\", \"res_med\")))\n\n\n[Note: Ideally, you would go back to cleaning EDA and add this level to the full dataset and then re-split into training, validation and test. This is a sloppy shortcut!]\n\nWith that fixed, let’s proceed:\n\nWe will collapse categories down to three levels (commercial, residential, floating village) as before but now using step_mutate() combined with fct_collapse() to do this inside of our recipe.\n\nWe will convert to dummy features using step_dummy(). The first level of the factor will be set to the reference level when we call step_dummy().\nstep_dummy() is a poor choice for function name. It actually uses whatever contrast coding we have set up in R. However, the default is are dummy coded contrasts (R calls this treatment contrasts). See ?contrasts and options(\"contrasts\") for more info.\n\n\n\nCode\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(sale_price ~ gr_liv_area + lot_area + year_built + garage_cars + ms_zoning, \n         data = data_trn) |&gt; \n  step_impute_median(garage_cars) |&gt; \n  step_mutate(ms_zoning = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\", \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n                                 \"floating\" = \"float\")) |&gt;\n  step_dummy(ms_zoning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding Sidebar\n\n\n\nYou should also read more about some other step_() functions that you might use for categorical predictors: - step_other() to combine all low frequency categories into a single “other” category. - step_unknown() to assign missing values their own category - You can use selector functions. For example, you could make dummy variables out of all of your factors in one step using step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()).\nSee the Step Functions - Dummy Variables and Encoding section on the tidymodels website for additional useful functions.\nWe have also described these in the section on factor steps in Appendix 1\n\n\n\nLet’s see if the addition of ms_zoning helped\n\nNotice the addition of the dummy coded features to the feature matrix\nNotice the removal of the factor ms_zoning\n\n\n\nCode\nrec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt; \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(NULL)\n\nfeat_val &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(data_val)\n\n\n\n\nskim\n\n\n\nCode\nfeat_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n7\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n0\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\nms_zoning_floating\n0\n1\n0.05\n0.21\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n4.38\n17.22\n\n\nms_zoning_residential\n0\n1\n0.94\n0.23\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n-3.86\n12.90\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfeat_val |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_val\n\n\nNumber of rows\n490\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n7\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1493.00\n483.78\n480\n1143.5\n1436.0\n1729.50\n3608\n0.92\n1.16\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10462.08\n10422.55\n1680\n7500.0\n9563.5\n11780.75\n215245\n15.64\n301.66\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.08\n30.96\n1875\n1954.0\n1975.0\n2000.00\n2010\n-0.66\n-0.41\n\n\ngarage_cars\n0\n1\n1.74\n0.76\n0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.00\n4\n-0.24\n0.22\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n178512.82\n75493.59\n35311\n129125.0\n160000.0\n213000.00\n556581\n1.42\n2.97\n\n\nms_zoning_floating\n0\n1\n0.05\n0.22\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.00\n1\n4.07\n14.58\n\n\nms_zoning_residential\n0\n1\n0.93\n0.25\n0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.00\n1\n-3.51\n10.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets fit a model with these features\n\n\n\nCode\nfit_lm_6 &lt;- \n  linear_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"lm\") |&gt; \n  fit(sale_price ~ ., data = feat_trn)\n\n\n\n\nplot it\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_truth(truth = feat_val$sale_price, \n           estimate = predict(fit_lm_6, feat_val)$.pred)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd evaluate it\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  model                              rmse_val\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 simple linear model                  51375.\n2 4 feature linear model               39903.\n3 4 feature linear model with YJ       41660.\n4 6 feature linear model w/ms_zoning   39846.\n\n\n\nRemoving Yeo Johnson transformation but adding dummy coded ms_zoning may have helped a little\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWill the addition of new predictors/features to a model always reduce RMSE in train? in validation?\n\n\n\nAs you know, the estimation procedure in linear models is OLS. Parameter estimates are derived to minimize the SSE in the data set in which they are derived. For this reason, adding a predictor will never increase RMSE in the training set and it will usually lower it even when it is not part of the DGP.\nHowever, this is not true in validation. A predictor will only meaningfully lower RMSE in validation if it is part of the DGP. Also, a bad predictor could even increase RMSE in validation due tooverfitting.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Ordinal Predictors\nWe have two paths to pursue for ordinal predictors\n\nWe can treat them like nominal predictors (e.g., dummy code)\nWe can treat them like numeric predictors (either raw or with an added transformation if needed)\n\n\nLet’s consider overall_qual\n\n\nCode\ndata_trn |&gt; \n  plot_categorical(\"overall_qual\", \"sale_price\") |&gt; \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations:\n\nLow frequency for low and to some degree high quality response options. If dummy coding, may want to collapse some (1-2)\nThere is a monotonic relationship (mostly linear) with sale_price. Treat as numeric?\nNot skewed so doesn’t likely need to be transformed if treated as numeric\nNumeric will take one feature vs. many (9?) features for dummy codes.\n\nDummy codes are more flexible but we may not need this flexibility (and unnecessary flexibility increases overfitting)\n\n\nLet’s add overall_qual to our model as numeric\nRemember that this predictor was ordinal so we paid special attention to the order of the levels when we classed this factor. Lets confirm they are in order\n\n\nCode\ndata_trn |&gt; pull(overall_qual) |&gt; levels()\n\n\n [1] \"1\"  \"2\"  \"3\"  \"4\"  \"5\"  \"6\"  \"7\"  \"8\"  \"9\"  \"10\"\n\n\n\nTo convert overall_qual to numeric (with levels in the specified order), we can use another simple mutate inside our recipe.\n\n\nCode\nrec &lt;- \n  recipe(sale_price ~  ~ gr_liv_area + lot_area + year_built + garage_cars + \n           ms_zoning + overall_qual, data = data_trn) |&gt; \n  step_impute_median(garage_cars) |&gt; \n  step_mutate(ms_zoning = fct_collapse(ms_zoning,\n                                 \"residential\" = c(\"res_high\", \"res_med\", \"res_low\"),\n                                 \"commercial\" = c(\"agri\", \"commer\", \"indus\"),\n                                 \"floating\" = \"float\"),\n              overall_qual = as.numeric(overall_qual)) |&gt;\n  step_dummy(ms_zoning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding Sidebar\n\n\n\nThere is a step function called step_ordinalscore() but it requires that the factor is classed as an ordered factor.

    "text": "3.9 Distance and Scaling in KNN\n\n3.9.1 Defining “Nearest”\nTo make a prediction for some new observation, we need to identify the observations from the training set that are nearest to it\n\nNeed a distance measure to define “nearest”\nIMPORTANT: We care only about:\n\nDistance between a validation observation and all the training observations\nNeed to find the \\(k\\) observations in training that are nearest to the validation observation (i.e., its neighbors)\nDistance is defined based on these observations’ features, not their outcomes\n\nThere are a number of different distance measures available (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, Cosine, Minkowski)\n\nEuclidean is most commonly used in KNN\n\n\n\nEuclidean distance between any two points is an n-dimensional extension of the Pythagorean formula (which applies explicitly with 2 features/2 dimensional space).\n\\(C^2 = A^2 + B^2\\)\n\\(C = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\)\n…where C is the distance between two points\n\nThe Euclidean distance between 2 points (p and q) in two dimensions (2 predictors, x1 = A, x2 = B)\n\\(Distance = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\)\n\\(Distance = \\sqrt{(q1 - p1)^2 + (q2 - p2)^2}\\)\n\\(Distance = \\sqrt{(2 - 1)^2 + (5 - 2)^2}\\)\n\\(Distance = 3.2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne dimensional (one feature) is simply the subtraction of scores on that feature (x1) between p and q\n\\(Distance = \\sqrt{(q1 - p1)^2}\\)\n\\(Distance = \\sqrt{(2 - 1)^2}\\)\n\\(Distance = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-dimensional generalization for n features:\n\\(Distance = \\sqrt{(q1 - p1)^2 + (q2 - p2)^2 + ... + (qn - pn)^2}\\)\n\nManhattan distance is also referred to as city block distance\n\nTravel down the “A” street for 1 unit\nTravel down the “B” street for 3 units\nTotal distance = 4 units\n\nFor two features/dimensions\n\\(Distance = |A + B|\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkknn() uses Minkowski distance (see Wikipedia or less mathematical description)\n\nIt is a more complex parameterized distance formula\n\nThis parameter is called p, referred to as distance in kknn()\n\nEuclidean and Manhattan distances are special cases where p = 2 and 1, respectively\nThe default p in kknn() = 2 (Euclidean distance)\n\nThis default (like all defaults) can be changed when you define the algorithm using nearest_neighbor()\n\n\n\n\n3.9.2 Scaling X\nDistance is dependent on scales of all the features. We need to put all features on the same scale\n\nScale all features to SD = 1 (using step_scale(all_numeric_predictors()))\nRange correct [0, 1] all features (using step_range(all_numeric_predictors()))\n\n\n\n\n3.9.3 Categorical Predictors\nKNN requires numeric features (for distance calculation).\n\nFor categorical predictors, you will need to use dummy coding or other feature engineering that results in numeric features.\ne.g., step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())",

    "text": "4.3 Logistic Regression: A Conceptual Review\nLogistic regression (a special case of the generalized linear model) estimates the conditional probability for each class given X (a specific set of values for our features)\n\nIn the binary outcome case, we will often refer to the two outcomes as the positive class and the negative class\nThis makes most sense in some applied settings where we are most interested in predicting if one of the two classes is likely, e.g.,\n\nPresence of heart disease\nPositive for some psychiatric diagnoses\nLapse back to alcohol use in people with alcohol use disorder\n\n\n\nLogistic regression is used frequently for binary and multi-level outcomes because\n\nThe general linear model makes predictions that are not bounded by [0, 1] and do not represent true estimates of conditional probability for each class\nLogistic regression approaches can be modified to accommodate multi-class outcomes (i.e., more than two levels) even when they are not ordered\nNonetheless, the general linear model is still used at times to predict binary outcomes (see Linear Probability Model) so you should be aware of it. We won’t discuss it further here.\n\n\n\nLogistic regression provides predicted conditional probabilities for one class (positive class) for any specific set of values for our features (X)\n\n\\(Pr(positive\\:class | X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}\\)\nThese conditional probabilities are bounded by [0, 1]\nTo maximize accuracy (as per Bayes classifier),\n\nwe predict the positive case if \\(Pr(positive class | X) &gt; .5\\) for any specific X\notherwise we predict the negative class\n\n\n\nAs a simple parametric model, logistic regression is commonly used for explanatory purposes as well as prediction\nFor these reasons, it is worthwhile to fully understand how to work with the logistic function to quantify and describe the effects of your features/predictors in terms of\n\nProbability\nOdds\n[Log-odds or logit]\nOdds ratio\n\n\nThe logistic function yields the probability of the positive class given X\n\nHowever, in some instances (e.g., horse racing, poker), it may make more sense to describe the odds of the positive case occurring rather than probability\n\nOdds are defined with respect to probabilities as follows:\n\n\\(odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|X)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|X)}\\)\n\n\nFor example, if the UW Badgers have a .5 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, their odds of winning are 1 (to 1)\n\n\\(\\frac{0.5} {1 - 0.5}\\)\n\nIf the UW Badgers have a .75 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, their odds of winning are 3 (:1; ‘3 to 1’)\n\n\\(\\frac{0.75} {1 - 0.75}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIf the UW Badgers have a .25 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, what are their odds of winning?\n\n\n\n.25 / (1 - .25) = 0.33 or 1:3\n\n\nThe logistic function can be modified to provide odds directly:\nLogistic function:\n\n\\(Pr(positive\\:class | X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}\\)\n\nDefinition of odds:\n\n\\(odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|X)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|X)}\\)\n\nSubstitute logistic function for \\(Pr(positive\\:class|X)\\) on top and bottom and simplify to get:\n\n\\(odds(positive\\:class|X) = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}\\)\nOdds are bounded by [0, \\(\\infty\\)]\n\n\nThe logistic function can be modified further such that the outcome (log-odds/logit) is a linear function of your features\nIf we take the natural log (base e) of both sides of the odds equation, we get:\n\n\\(log(odds(positive\\:class|X)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p\\)\nLog-odds are unbounded \\([-\\infty, \\infty]\\)\n\nUse of logit transformation:\n\nprovides the connection between the general linear model and generalized linear models (in this case with link = logit, family = binomial).\n\nNotice that the logit/log-odds is a linear combination of the features (just like in the general linear model)\n\n\nOdds and probability are descriptive but they are not linear functions of X\n\nTherefore, parameter estimates from these models aren’t very useful to describe the effect of features\nThis is because unit change in Y per unit change in any specific feature is not the same for all values of the feature\n\n\nLog-odds are a linear function of X\n\nTherefore, you can say that log-odds of positive class increases by \\(b_1\\) (our estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\)) for every one unit increase in \\(x_1\\)\nHowever, log-odds are NOT very descriptive/intuitive so they are not that useful for explanatory purposes\n\n\nThe odds ratio addresses these problems\nOdds are defined at a specific set of values across the features in your model. For example, with one feature:\n\n\\(odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)}\\)\n\nThe odds ratio describes the change in odds for a change of c units in your feature. With some manipulation:\n\n\\(Odds\\:ratio  =  \\frac{odds(x+c)}{odds(x)}\\)\n\\(Odds\\:ratio  =  \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*(x_1 + c)}}{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_1}}\\)\n\\(Odds\\:ratio  = e^{c*\\beta_1}\\)\n\n\nAs an example, if we fit a logistic regression model to predict the probability of the Badgers winning a home football game given the attendance (measured in individual spectators at the game), we might find \\(b_1\\) (our estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\)) = .000075.\nGiven this, the odds ratio associated with every increase in 10,000 spectators:\n\n\\(= e^{c * \\b_1}\\)\n\\(= e^{10000 * .000075}\\)\n\\(= 2.1\\)\nFor every increase of 10,000 spectators, the odds of the Badgers winning doubles",

first.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can explore responses for categorical variables\n\nOther than name, responses for all other variables are tidy\nname has many different responses\nWe won’t know how to handle

    "text": "4.6 K Nearest Neighbors - A Conceptual Overview\nLet’s switch gears to a non-parametric method we already know - KNN.\n\nKNN can be used as a classifier as well as for regression problems\nKNN tries to determine conditional class possibilities for any set of features by looking at observed classes for similar values of for these features in the training set\n\n\nThis figure illustrates the application of 3-NN to a small sample training set (N = 12) with 2 predictors\n\nFor test observation X in the left panel, we would predict class = blue because blue is the majority class (highest probability) among the 3 nearest training observations\nIf we calculated these probabilities for all possible combinations of the two predictors in the training set, it would yield the decision boundaries depicted in the right panel\n\n\n\nKNN can produce complex decision boundaries\n\nThis makes it flexible (can reduce bias)\nThis makes it susceptible to variance/overfitting problems\n\nRemember that we can control this bias-variance trade-off with K.\n\nAs K increases, variance reduces (but bias may increase).\n\nAs K decreases, bias may be reduced but variance increases.\nChoose a K that produces good performance in new (validation) data\n\n\nThese figures depict the KNN (and Bayes classifier) decision boundaries for the earlier simulated 2 class problem with X1 and X2\n\nK = 10 appears to provide the sweet spot b/c it closely approximates the Bayes decision boundary\nOf course, you wouldn’t know the true Bayes decision boundary if the data were real (not simulated)\nBut K = 10 would also yield the lowest test error (which is how it should be chosen)\n\nBayes classifier test error: .1304\nK = 10 test error: .1363\nK = 1 test error: .1695\nK = 100 test err: .1925\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can NOT make the decision about K based on training error\nThis figure depicts training and test error for simulated data example as function of 1/K\n\nTraining error decreases as 1/K increases. At 1 (K=1) training error is 0\nTest error shows expected inverted U\n\nFor high K (left side), error is high because of high variance\nAs move right (lower K), variance is reduced rapidly with little increase in bias. Error is reduced.\nEventually, there is diminishing return from reducing variance but bias starts to increase rapidly. Error increases again.",

These parameter estimates can be tested via inferential procedures.\nKNN does not provide any parameter estimates. With KNN, we can visualize decision boundary (only in 2 or three dimensions) or the predicted outcome by any feature, controlling for other features but these relationships may be complex in shape.\nOf course, if the relationships are complex, we might not want to hide that.\nWe will learn more about feature importance for explanation in a later unit.\n\n\nPlot of probability of high_mpg by year, holding beef_1 constant at its mean based on 10-NN\n\nGet \\(Pr(high|year)\\) holding beef constant at its mean\npredict() returns probabilities for high and low.\n\n\n\nCode\np_high &lt;- \n  tibble(year = seq(min(feat_val$year), max(feat_val$year), .1),\n         beef_1 = mean(feat_val$beef_1)) \n\np_high &lt;- p_high |&gt; \n  bind_cols(predict(fit_10nn_2, p_high, type = \"prob\")) |&gt; \n  glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 33\nColumns: 4\n$ year       &lt;dbl&gt; 18.99759, 19.09759, 19.19759, 19.29759, 19.39759, 19.49759,…\n$ beef_1     &lt;dbl&gt; 0.004400185, 0.004400185, 0.004400185, 0.004400185, 0.00440…\n$ .pred_low  &lt;dbl&gt; 0.96, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.97, 0.87, 0.81, 0.81, 0.81, 0.81,…\n$ .pred_high &lt;dbl&gt; 0.04, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.13, 0.19, 0.19, 0.19, 0.19,…\n\n\n\n\nPlot it\nIn a later unit, we will learn about feature ablation that we can combine with model comparisons to potentially test predictor effects in non-parametric models\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = feat_val, aes(x = year, y = as.numeric(mpg) - 1), \n             position = position_jitter(height = 0.05, width = 0.05)) +\n  geom_line(data = p_high, mapping = aes(x = year, y = .pred_high)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Production Year (19XX)\", \n                     breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 7), \n                     labels = as.character(seq(70, 82, length.out = 7))) +\n  ylab(\"Pr(High MPG)\")",

    "text": "5.2 Some Technical Details for Costly Computations\nBefore we dive into resampling, we need to introduce two coding techniques that can save us a lot of time when implementing resampling methods\n\nParallel processing\nCaching time-consuming computations\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Parallel Processing\nWhen using resampling, we often end up fitting many, many model configurations\n\nThis can be the same model configuration in many different training sets\nOr many different model configurations in many different training sets (even more computationally demanding)\n\nCritically\n\nThe fitting process for each of these configurations is independent for the others\nThe order that the configurations are fit doesn’t matter either\nWhen these two criteria are met, the processes can be run in parallel with an often big time savings\n\n\nTo do this in R, we need to set up a parallel processing backend\n\nLots of options and details depending on the code you intend to run in parallel to do it really well\nWe can discuss some of these issues/details and other solutions (i.e., High Throughput Computing at CHTC)\nSome options are OS specific\nProvide more details elsewhere\n\n\nTLDR - copy the following code chunk into your scripts after you load your other libraries (e.g., tidyverse and tidymodels)\n\n\nCode\ncl &lt;- parallel::makePSOCKcluster(parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE))\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Using Cache\nEven with parallel processing, resampling procedures can STILL take a lot of time, particularly on notebook computers that don’t have a lot of cores available\nIn these instances, you may also want to consider caching the result\n\nWhen you cache some set of calculations, you are essentially saving the results of the calculations\nIf you need to run the script again, you simply load the saved calculations again from disk, rather than re-calculating them (its much quicker to just read them from a file)\n\nBut…\n\nYou need to redo the calculations if you change anything in your script that could affect them\nThis is called “invalidating the cache”\nYou need to be very careful to reuse the cache when you can but also to invalidate it when the calculations have changed\n\n\nIn other notes, we describe three options to cache calculations that are available in R.\n\nYou should read more about those options if you plan to use one\nOur preferred solution is to use xfun::cache_rds()\nRead the help for this function (?xfun::cache_rds) if you plan to use it\nCache is complicated and can lead to errors.\n\nBut cache can also save you a lot of time during development!\n\n\nStart by loading only that function for the xfun package. You can add this line of code after your other libraries (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels)\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(xfun, include.only = \"cache_rds\")\n\n\n\nTo use the function\n\nYou will pass the code for the calculations you want to cache as the first argument (expr) to the function inside a set of curly brackets {}\nYou need to list the path (dir =) and filename (file =) for the rds file that will save the cached calculations.\n\nThe / at the end of the path is needed.\n\nYou should use a meaningful (and distinct) filename.\n\nProvide rerun = FALSE as a third argument.\n\nYou can set this to true temporarily if you need to invalidate the cache to redo the calculations\nWe like to set it up as an environment variable (see rerun_setting below)\nKeep it as FALSE during development\nSet it to TRUE at the end of our development so that we make sure we didn’t make any cache invalidation errors\n\nYou may also provide a list of globals to hash =. See more details at previous link\n\n\n\nCode\ncache_rds(\n  expr = {\n },\n dir = \"cache/\",\n file = \"filename\", \n rerun = rerun_setting \n)\n\n\nWe will demonstrate the use of this function throughout the book. BUT you do not need to use it if you find it confusing.",

    "text": "5.3 Introduction to Resampling\nWe will use resampling for two goals:\n\nTo select among model configurations based on relative performance estimates of these configurations in new data\nTo evaluate the performance of our best/final model configuration in new data\n\nFor both of these goals we are using new data to estimate performance of model configuration(s)\n\nThere are two kinds of problems that can emerge from using a sub-optimal resampling approach\n\nWe can get a biased estimate of model performance (i.e., we can systematically under or over-estimate its performance)\nWe can get an imprecise estimate of model performance (i.e., high variance in our model performance metric if it was repeatedly calculated in different samples of held-out data)\n\n\nEssentially, this is the bias and variance problem again, but now not with respect to the model’s actual performance but instead with our estimate of how the model will perform\nThis is a very important distinction to keep in mind or you will be confused as we discuss bias and variance into the future. We have:\n\nbias and variance of model performance (i.e., the predictions the model makes)\nbias and variance of our estimate of how well the model will perform in new data\ndifferent factors affect each\n\n\nLet’s get a dataset for this unit.

If we trained the same model configuration with all of our data, that model would be expected to performance better than the N-151 model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhy will the N = 303 model always be better (or at worst equivalent) to the model trained with N = 151.\n\n\n\nIncreasing the sample size used to fit our model configuration will decrease model variance but not change model bias. This will produce overall lower error.\nThis might not be true if the additional data were not similar quality to our training data but we know our validation/test set is similar because we did a random resample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nSo why did we not just fit this model configuration using N = 303 to start?\n\n\n\nBecause then we would not have had any new data left to get an estimate of its performance in new data!\n\n\n\nIf you plan to actually use your model in the real world for prediction, you should always re-fit the best configuration using all available data!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nBut what does this mean about our estimate of the performance of this final model (fit with all available data) data when we get that estimate using a model that as fit with a smaller sample size (the sample size in our training set)?\n\n\n\nOur estimate will likely be biased. It will underestimate the true expected peformance of our final model. We can think of it as a lower bound on that expected performance. The amount of bias will be a function of the difference between the sample size of the training set and the size the of full dataset. If we want less biased estimates, we want to allocate as much data as possible to the training set when estimating the performance of our final model configuration (but this will come with other costs!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nContrast the costs/benefits of a 50/50 vs. 80/20 split for train and test\n\n\n\nUsing a training set with 80% of the sample will yield a less biased (under) estimate of the final (using all data) model performance than a training set with 50% of the sample.\nHowever, using a test set of 20% of the data will produce a more variable (less precise) estimate of performance than the 50% test set.\nThis is another bias-variance trade off but now instead of talking about model performance, we are seeing that we have to trade off bias and variance in our estimate of the model performance too!\n\n\nThis recognition of a bias-variance trade-off in our performance estimates is what motivates the more complicated resampling approaches we will now consider.\n\nIn our example, we plan to use this model for future predictions, so now lets fit it a final time using the full dataset\n\nWe do this manually\nNOTE: tidymodels has routines to do all of this including fitting final models (read more about “workflows”)\nWe do not use them in the course because they hide steps that are important for conceptual understanding\nWe do not use them in our lab because we break apart all of these steps to train models using high throughput computing\n\n\nMake a feature matrix for the full dataset\nWe are now using the full data set as our new training set so we prep and bake with the full dataset\n\n\nCode\nrec_prep &lt;- rec_lr |&gt; \n  prep(data_all)\n\nfeat_all &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(NULL)\n\n\n\nAnd then fit your model configuration\n\n\nCode\nfit_lr &lt;-\n  logistic_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"glm\") |&gt; \n  fit(disease ~ ., data = feat_all)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfit_lr |&gt; tidy()\n\n\n# A tibble: 17 × 5\n   term                    estimate std.error statistic     p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 (Intercept)             -5.06      2.79       -1.81  0.0704     \n 2 age                     -0.0185    0.0235     -0.787 0.431      \n 3 rest_bp                  0.0240    0.0109      2.20  0.0279     \n 4 chol                     0.00414   0.00376     1.10  0.271      \n 5 max_hr                  -0.0204    0.0104     -1.96  0.0497     \n 6 exer_st_depress          0.275     0.212       1.30  0.195      \n 7 ca                       1.32      0.263       5.00  0.000000566\n 8 sex_male                 1.43      0.489       2.92  0.00345    \n 9 cp_atyp_ang              1.05      0.752       1.40  0.162      \n10 cp_non_anginal           1.24      0.602       2.06  0.0396     \n11 fbs_yes                 -0.812     0.522      -1.55  0.120      \n12 rest_ecg_abnormal        0.469     0.364       1.29  0.197      \n13 exer_ang_yes             1.24      0.401       3.10  0.00195    \n14 exer_st_slope_flat       1.08      0.442       2.43  0.0150     \n15 exer_st_slope_downslope  0.468     0.819       0.572 0.568      \n16 thal_fixeddefect         0.262     0.759       0.345 0.730      \n17 thal_reversabledefect    1.41      0.397       3.54  0.000396   \n\n\nIf we need to predict disease in the future, this is the model we would use (with these parameter estimates)\nOur estimate of its future accuracy is based on our previous assessment using the held-in training set to fit the model configuration and the held-out test set to estimate its performance\nThis estimate should be considered a lower bound on its expected performance",

    "section": "5.5 Leave One Out Cross Validation",
    "text": "5.5 Leave One Out Cross Validation\nLet’s turn to a new resampling technique and start with some questions to motivate it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow could you use this single validation set approach to get the least biased estimate of model performance with your n = 303 dataset that would still allow you to estimate its performance in a held out test set?\n\n\n\nPut all but one case into the training set (i.e., leave only one case out in the test set). In our example, you would fit a model with n = 302 this model will have essentially equivalent overfitting as n = 303 so it will not yield much bias when we use it to estimate the performance of the n = 303 model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat will be the biggest problem with this approach?\n\n\n\nYou will estimate performance with only n = 1 in the test set. This means there will be high variance in your performance estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow might you reduce this problem?\n\n\n\nRepeat this split between training and test n times so that there are n different sets of n = 1 test sets. Then average the performance across all n of these test sets to get a more stable estimate of performance. Averaging is a good way to reduce the variance of any estimate.\nThis is leave one out cross-validation!\n\n\nComparisons across LOOCV and single validation set approaches\n\nThe performance estimate from LOOCV has less bias than the single validation set method (because the models that are used to estimate performance were fit with close to the full n of the final model that will be fit to all the data)\nLOOCV uses all observations in the held-out set at some point. This may yield less variance than single 20% or 50% validation set?\n\nbut…\n\nLOOCV can be computationally expensive (need to fit and evaluate the same model configuration n times).\n\nThis is a real problem when you are also working with a high number of model configurations (i.e., number fits = n * number of model configurations).\n\n\nLOOCV eventually uses all the data in the held-out set across the ‘n’ held-out sets.\n\nAveraging also helps reduce variance in the performance metric.\nHowever, averaging reduces variance to a greater degree when the performance measures being averaged are less related/more independent.\nThe n fitted models are very similar in LOOCV b/c they are each fit on almost the same data (each with n-1 observations)\n\nK-fold cross validation (next method) improves the variance of the average performance metric by averaging across more independent (less overlapping) training sets\n\nFor this reason, it is superior and (always?) preferred over LOOCV\nWe are not demonstrating LOOCV b/c we strongly prefer other methods (k-fold)\nStill important to understand it conceptually and its strengths/weaknesses\nIf you wanted to use this resampling approach, simply substitute loo_cv() for vfold_cv() in the next example",

    "text": "5.10 Using Resampling to Select Best Model Configurations\nIn all of the previous examples, we have used various resampling methods only to evaluate the performance of a single model configuration in new data. In these instances, we were treating the held-out sets as test sets.\nResampling is also used to get held out performance estimates to select best model configurations.\nBest means the model configuration that performs the best in new data and therefore is closest to the true DGP for the data\n\nFor example, we might want to select among model configurations in an explanatory scenario to have a principled approach to determine the model configuration that best matches the true DGP (and would be best to test your hypotheses). e.g.,\n\nSelecting covariates to include\nDeciding on X transformations\nOutlier identification approach\nStatistical algorithm\n\n\nWe can simply get performance estimates for each configuration using one of the previously described resampling methods\n\nWe would call the held-out data (the single set, the folds, the OOB samples) a validation set\nWe select the model configuration with the best mean (or median?) across our resampled validation sets on the relevant performance metric.\n\n\nOne additional common scenario where you will do model selection across many model configurations is when “tuning” (i.e., selecting) the best values for hyperparameters for a statistical algorithm (e.g., k in KNN).\n\ntidymodels makes this easy and it follows a very similar workflow as earlier with a few changes\n\nWe will need to indicate which hyperparameters we plan to tune in the statistical algorithm\nWe need (or can) select values to consider for that hyperparameter (or we can let the tune package functions decide in some cases)\nWe will now use tune_grid() rather fit_resamples() to fit and evaluate the models configurations that differ with respect to their hyperparameters\nThis IS computationally costly.

As K increases, model bias increases but model variance decreases. In most instances, model variance decreases faster than model bias increases. Therefore performance should increase and then peak at a good point along the bias-variance trade-off. Beyond this optimal value, performance should decrease again. You want to select a hyperparameter value that is associated with peak (or near peak) performance.\n\nThe simplest way to select among model configurations (e.g., hyperparameters) is to choose the model configuration with the best performance\n\n\nCode\nshow_best(fits_knn_boot, n = 10)\n\n\nWarning in show_best(fits_knn_boot, n = 10): No value of `metric` was given;\n\"accuracy\" will be used.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 7\n   neighbors .metric  .estimator  mean     n std_err .config              \n       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                \n 1       145 accuracy binary     0.819   100 0.00321 Preprocessor1_Model49\n 2       148 accuracy binary     0.819   100 0.00323 Preprocessor1_Model50\n 3       142 accuracy binary     0.819   100 0.00324 Preprocessor1_Model48\n 4       124 accuracy binary     0.818   100 0.00310 Preprocessor1_Model42\n 5       121 accuracy binary     0.818   100 0.00309 Preprocessor1_Model41\n 6       136 accuracy binary     0.818   100 0.00323 Preprocessor1_Model46\n 7       139 accuracy binary     0.818   100 0.00323 Preprocessor1_Model47\n 8       133 accuracy binary     0.818   100 0.00319 Preprocessor1_Model45\n 9       130 accuracy binary     0.818   100 0.00316 Preprocessor1_Model44\n10       127 accuracy binary     0.818   100 0.00314 Preprocessor1_Model43\n\n\nCode\nselect_best(fits_knn_boot)\n\n\nWarning in select_best(fits_knn_boot): No value of `metric` was given;\n\"accuracy\" will be used.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  neighbors .config              \n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                \n1       145 Preprocessor1_Model49\n\n\n\nThe next most common is to choose the simplest (least flexible) model that has performance within one SE of the best performing configuration.\n\nUse select_by_one_std_err()\nSort performance results from least to most flexible (e.g., desc(neighbors))\n\n\n\nCode\nselect_by_one_std_err(fits_knn_boot, \n                      desc(neighbors))\n\n\nWarning in select_by_one_std_err(fits_knn_boot, desc(neighbors)): No value of\n`metric` was given; \"accuracy\" will be used.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  neighbors .config              \n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                \n1       148 Preprocessor1_Model50\n\n\n\n\nWe should also refit a final model with the “best” hyperparameter using the full data as before\n\n\n\nCode\nrec_prep &lt;- rec_knn |&gt;   \n  prep(data_all)\n\nfeat_all &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(NULL)\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the select_*() from above to use this best hyperparameter in our specification of the algorithm\nNote that we now fit using all the data and switch to fit() rather than tune_grid()\n\n\n\nCode\nfit_knn_best &lt;-\n  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = select_best(fits_knn_boot)$neighbors) |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"kknn\") |&gt; \n  set_mode(\"classification\") |&gt;\n  fit(disease ~ ., data = feat_all)\n\n\nWarning in select_best(fits_knn_boot): No value of `metric` was given; \"accuracy\" will be used.\nNo value of `metric` was given; \"accuracy\" will be used.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we can’t use the previous bootstrap resampling to evaluate this final/best model because we already used it to select this the best configuration\nWe need new, held-out data to evaluate it (a new test set!)",

    "text": "5.11 Resampling for Both Model Selection and Evaluation\nResampling methods can be used to get model performance estimates to select the best model configuration and/or evaluate that best model\n\nSo far we have done EITHER selection OR evaluation but not both together\nThe concepts to both select the best configuration and evaluation it are similar but it requires different (slightly more complicated) resampling than what we have done so far\n\n\n\nIf you use your held-out resamples to select the best model among a number of model configurations then the same held-out resamples cannot also be used to evaluate the performance of that same best model\nIf it is, the performance metric will have optimization bias. To the degree that there is any noise (i.e., variance) in the measurement of performance, selecting the best model configuration will capitalize on this noise.\nYou need to use one set of held out resamples (validation sets) to select the best model. Then you need a DIFFERENT set of held out resamples (test sets) to evaluate that best model.\n\n\nThere are two strategies for this:\n\nStrategy 1:\n\nFirst, hold out a test set for final/best model evaluation (using initial_split()).\n\nThen use one of the above resampling methods (single validation set approach, k-fold, or bootstrap) to select the best model configuration.\n\nBootstrap is likely best option b/c it is typically more precise (though biased)\n\nStrategy 2: Nested resampling. More on this in a moment\n\n\nOther Observations about Common Practices:\n\nSimple resampling methods with the full sample (and no held-out test set) to both select AND evaluate are still common\nFailure by some (even Kuhn) to appreciate the degree of optimization bias\nParticular problem in Psychology because of small n (high variance in our performance metric)?\nCan be fine if you just want to find the best model configuration but don’t need to evaluate its performance rigorously (i.e., you don’t really care that much about validity of your performance estimate of your final model and are fine with it being a bit optimistic)\n\n\n\n5.11.1 Bootstrap with Test Set\n\nFirst we divide our data into training and test using inital_split()\nNext, we use bootstrap resampling with the training set to split training into many held-in and held-out sets. We use these held-out (OOB) sets as validation sets to select the best model configuration based on mean/median performance across those sets.\nAfter we select the best model configuration using bootstrap resampling of the training set\n\nWe refit that model configuration in the FULL training set\nAnd we use that model to predict into the test set to evaluate it\n\nOf course, in the end, if you plan to use the model, you will refit this final model configuration to the FULL dataset but the performance estimate for that model will come from test set on th previous step (there are no more data to estimate new performance)\n\n\n\nUse initial_split() for first train/test split\n\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(123456)\nsplits_test &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  initial_split(prop = 2/3, strata = \"disease\")\n\ndata_trn &lt;- splits_test |&gt; \n  analysis()\n\ndata_test &lt;- splits_test |&gt; \n  assessment()\n\n\n\n\nUse training set for model selection via resampling (in this case bootstrap)\nNo need for another seed\n\n\n\nCode\nsplits_boot_trn &lt;- data_trn |&gt; \n  bootstraps(times = 100, strata = \"disease\") \n\n\n\nUse the same grid of hyperparameters we set up earlier (hyper_grid)\n\n\n\nFit model configurations that vary by K in all 100 bootstrap samples\nMake predictions and calculate accuracy for these fitted models in 100 OOB (validation) sets\n\n\n\nCode\nfits_knn_boot_trn &lt;- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) |&gt; \n      set_engine(\"kknn\") |&gt; \n      set_mode(\"classification\") |&gt;\n      tune_grid(preprocessor = rec_knn, \n                resamples = splits_boot_trn, \n                grid = hyper_grid, \n                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n  },\n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_knn_boot_trn\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n\n\n\n\nSelect the best model configuration (best k)\n\nK = 97 is the best model configuration determined by bootstrap resampling\nBUT this is NOT the correct estimate of its performance in new data\nWe compared 50 model configurations (values of k).

In this case, 1/3 of the total sample size.\n\nThis will yield a high variance/imprecise estimate of model performance\n\nIt also yields a biased estimate of model performance\n\nThe model we evaluated in test was fit to only the training data which was only 2/3 of total sample size\nYet our true final model is trained with the full dataset\nWe are likely underestimating its true performance\n\n\n\nNested resampling offers an improvement with respect to these two issues\nNested resampling involves two loops\n\nThe inner loop is used for model selection\nThe outer loop is used for model evaluation\n\nNested resampling is VERY CONFUSING at first (like the first year you use it!)\nNested resampling isn’t fully supported by tidymodels as of yet. You have to do some coding to iterate over the outer loop\nApplication of nested resampling is outside the scope of this course but you should understand it conceptually. For further reading on the implementation of this method, see an example provided by the tidymodels folks.\n\nA ‘simple’ example using bootstrap for inner loop and 10-fold CV for outer loop\n\nDivide the full sample into 10 folds\nIterate through those 10 folds as follows (this is the outer loop)\n\nHold out fold 1\nUse folds 2-10 to do the inner loop bootstrap\n\nBootstrap these folds B times\nFit models in B bootstrap samples\nCalculate selection performance metrics in B out-of-bag samples\nAverage the B bootstrapped selection performance metrics for each model configuration\nSelect the best model configuration using this average bootstrapped selection performance metric\n\nUse best model configuration from folds 2-10 to make predictions for the held-out fold 1 to get the first (of ten) evaluation performance metrics\nRepeat for held out fold 2 - 10\n\nAverage the 10 evaluation performance metrics.

Bootstrap yields low variance performance estimates (but they are biased). We want low variance to select best model configuration. K-fold is a good method for less biased performance estimates. We want less bias in our final evaluation of our best model. You can do repeated K-fold in the outer loop to both reduce its variance and give you a sense of the performance sampling distribution.

It would not predict well in new data from the same quadratic DGP\nAlso, the model would have high variance (if we estimated the parameters in another N = 5 training set, they would be very different)\n\n\n\nThis problem with overfitting and variance isn’t limited to polynomial regression.\n\nWe would have the same problem (perfect fit in training with poor fit in new val data) if we predicted housing prices with many features when the training N = 5. e.g.,\n\\(\\hat{sale\\_price_i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * size + \\beta_2 * year\\_built + \\beta_3 * num\\_garages + \\beta_4 * quality\\)\n\n\nObviously, the correct model to fit is a second order polynomial model with size\n\n\\(\\hat{sale\\_price_i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * size + \\beta_2 * size^2\\)\nBut we couldn’t know this with real data because we wouldn’t know the underlying DGP\nWhen we don’t know the underlying DGP, we need to be able to consider potentially complex models with many features in some way that diminishes the potential problem with overfitting/model variance\n\n\n\nWhat if we still fit a fourth order polynomial but changed the cost function to penalize the absolute value of \\(\\beta_3\\) and \\(\\beta_4\\) parameter estimates?\nTypical cost based on MSE/squared loss:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^{2}\\)\n\nOur new cost function:\n\n\\([\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^{2}] +  [1000 * \\beta_3 + 1000 * \\beta_4]\\)\n\n\n\\([\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^{2}] + [1000 * \\beta_3 + 1000 * \\beta_4]\\)\n\nThe only way to make the value of this new cost function small is to make \\(\\beta_3\\) and \\(\\beta_4\\) small\nIf we made the penalty applied to \\(\\beta_3\\) and \\(\\beta_4\\) large (e.g., 1000 as above), we will end up with the parameter estimates for these two features at approximately 0.\nWith a sufficient penalty applied, their parameter estimates will only change from zero to the degree that these changes accounted for a large enough drop in MSE to offset this penalty in the overall aggregate cost function.\n\n\n\\([\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^{2}] + 1000 * \\beta_3 + 1000 * \\beta_4\\)\n\nWith this penalty in place, our final model might shift from the blue model to the pink model below. The pink model is mostly quadratic but with a few extra “wiggles” if \\(\\beta_3\\) and \\(\\beta_4\\) are not exactly 0.\n\n\n\nOf course, we don’t typically know in advance which parameter estimates to penalize.\n\nInstead, we apply some penalty to all the parameter estimates (except \\(\\beta_0\\))\nThis shrinks the parameter estimates for all the features to some degree\nHowever, features that do reduce MSE meaningfully will be “worth” including with non-zero parameter estimates\nYou can also control the shrinkage by controlling the size of the penalty\n\n\nIn general, regularization produces models that:\n\nAre simpler (e.g. smoother, smaller coefficients/parameter estimates)\nAre less prone to overfitting\nAllow for models with p &gt;&gt; n\nAre sometimes more interpretable (LASSO, Elastic Net)\n\nThese benefits are provided by the introduction of some bias into the parameter estimates\nThis allows for a bias-variance trade-off where some bias is introduced for a big reduction in variance of model fit\n\nWe will now consider three regularization approaches that introduce different types of penalties to shrink the parameter estimates\n\nL2 (Ridge)\nL1 (LASSO)\nElastic net\n\nThese approaches are available for both regression and classification problems and for a variety of parametric statistical algorithms\nA fourth common regularized classification model (also sometimes used for regression) is the support vector machine (not covered in class but commonly used as well and easy to understand with this foundation)\nEach of these approaches uses a different specific penalty, which has implications for how the model performs in different settings",

It is unbiased but with higher variance than for non-zero values of lambda\n\n\nLets compare Ridge regression to OLS (ordinary least squares with squared loss cost function) linear regression\n\nRidge parameter estimates are biased but have lower variance (smaller SE) than OLS\nRidge may predict better in new data\n\nThis depends on the value of \\(\\lambda\\) selected and its impact on bias-variance trade-off in Ridge regression vs. OLS\nThere does exist a value of \\(\\lambda\\) for which Ridge predicts better than OLS in new data\n\nRidge regression (but not OLS) allows for p &gt; (or even &gt;&gt;) than n\nRidge regression (but not OLS) accommodates highly correlated (or even perfectly multi-collinear) features\nOLS (but not Ridge regression) is scale invariant\n\nYou should scale (mean and standard deviation correct) features for use with Ridge regression\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{n}([\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^{2}] + [\\:\\lambda\\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\beta_j^{2}\\:])\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhy does the scale of the features matter for Ridge regression?\n\n\n\nFeatures with bigger SDs will have smaller parameter estimates. Therefore they will be less affected by the penalty.\nUnless the features are on the same scale to start, you should standardize them for all applications (regression and classification) of Ridge (and also LASSO and elastic net). You can handle this during feature engineering in the recipe.",

A false positive might mean that we do more testing that is unnecessary and later find out they do not have heart disease. This comes with some monetary cost and also likely some distress for the patient. However, a false negative means we send the patient home thinking they are healthy and may suffer a heart attack or other bad outcome. That seems worse if this is only a preliminary screen.",

    "text": "8.4 The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\nLet’s return now to consider sensitivity and specificity again\nRemember that our classifier is estimating the probability of an observation being in the positive class.\nWe dichotomize this probability when we formally make a class prediction\n\nIf the probability &gt; 50%, we classify the observation as positive\nIf the probability &lt;= 50%, we classify the observation as negative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How can we improve sensitivity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a more liberal/lower classification threshold for saying someone has heart disease.\nFor example, rather than requiring a 50% probability to classify as yes for heart disease, we could lower to 20% for the classification threshold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What will the consequences of this change be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the Bayes classifier threshold of 50% produces the highest overall accuracy so accuracy will generally (though not always) drop when you shift from 50%.\nIf we think about this change as it applies to the columns of our confusion matrix, we will now catch more of the yes (fewer false negatives/misses), so sensitivity will go up. This was the goal of the lower threshold. However, we will also end up with more false positives so specificity will drop. If you consider the rows of the confusion matrix, we will have more false positives so the PPV will drop.\nHowever, we will have fewer false negatives so the NPV will increase. Whether these trade-offs are worth it are a function of the cost of different types of errors and how much you gain and lose with regard to each type of performance metric (ROC can inform this; more in a moment)\n\n\n\nCode\nautoplot(cm, type = \"heatmap\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, we simply used predict(fit_glmnet, feat_test)$.pred_class.\n$.pred_class dichotomized at 50% by default\n\nThis is the classification threshold to use with predicted probabilities that will produce the best overall accuracy (e.g., Bayes classifier)\nHowever, we can use a different threshold to increase sensitivity or specificity\nThis comes at a cost to the other characteristic (its a trade-off)\n\nLower threshold increases sensitivity but decreases specificity\nHigher threshold increases specificity but decreases sensitivity\n\n\n\nIt is relatively easy to make a new confusion matrix and get new performance metrics with a different classification threshold\n\nMake a tibble with truth and predicted probabilities\n\n\n\nCode\npreds &lt;- tibble(truth = feat_test$disease,\n                prob = predict(fit_glmnet, feat_test, type = \"prob\")$.pred_yes)\n\n\nWarning in select_best(fits_glmnet): No value of `metric` was given; \"accuracy\"\nwill be used.\n\n\nCode\npreds\n\n\n# A tibble: 428 × 2\n   truth    prob\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 no    0.0160 \n 2 no    0.117  \n 3 no    0.0200 \n 4 no    0.00231\n 5 no    0.00984\n 6 no    0.00143\n 7 no    0.00507\n 8 no    0.0421 \n 9 no    0.00773\n10 no    0.103  \n# ℹ 418 more rows\n\n\n\n\nUse this to get class estimates at any threshold we want\nHere we threshold at 20%\n\n\n\nCode\npreds &lt;- preds |&gt; \n  mutate(estimate_20 = if_else(prob &lt;= .20, \"no\", \"yes\"),\n         estimate_20 = factor(estimate_20, levels = c(\"yes\", \"no\"))) |&gt; \n  print()\n\n\n# A tibble: 428 × 3\n   truth    prob estimate_20\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;      \n 1 no    0.0160  no         \n 2 no    0.117   no         \n 3 no    0.0200  no         \n 4 no    0.00231 no         \n 5 no    0.00984 no         \n 6 no    0.00143 no         \n 7 no    0.00507 no         \n 8 no    0.0421  no         \n 9 no    0.00773 no         \n10 no    0.103   no         \n# ℹ 418 more rows\n\n\n\nWe can now make a confusion matrix for this new set of truth and estimates using the 20% threshold\n\n\nCode\ncm_20 &lt;- preds |&gt; \n  conf_mat(truth = truth, estimate = estimate_20)\n\ncm_20\n\n\n          Truth\nPrediction yes  no\n       yes  35  37\n       no   12 344\n\n\nLet’s compare to 50% (original)\n\n\nCode\ncm\n\n\n          Truth\nPrediction yes  no\n       yes  30  13\n       no   17 368\n\n\n\nAnd let’s compare these two thresholds on a subset of our numeric metrics\n\n20% threshold\n\n\n\nCode\ncm_20 |&gt; \n  summary() |&gt; \n  filter(.metric %in% c(\"accuracy\", \"sens\", \"spec\", \"ppv\", \"npv\")) |&gt; \n  select(-.estimator)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  .metric  .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy     0.886\n2 sens         0.745\n3 spec         0.903\n4 ppv          0.486\n5 npv          0.966\n\n\n\n50% threshold\n\n\n\nCode\ncm |&gt; \n  summary() |&gt; \n  filter(.metric %in% c(\"accuracy\", \"sens\", \"spec\", \"ppv\", \"npv\")) |&gt; \n  select(-.estimator)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  .metric  .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy     0.930\n2 sens         0.638\n3 spec         0.966\n4 ppv          0.698\n5 npv          0.956\n\n\nDo the changes on each of these metrics make sense to you? If not, please review these previous slides again!\n\nYou can begin to visualize the classifier performance by threshold simply by plotting histograms of the predicted positive class probabilities, separately for the true positive and negative classes\n\nLet’s look at our classifier\nIdeally, the probabilities are mostly low for the true negative class (“no”) and mostly high for the true positive class (“yes”)\nYou can imagine how any specific probability cut point would affect specificity (apply cut to the left panel) or sensitivity (apply cut to the right panel)\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = preds, aes(x = prob)) + \n   geom_histogram(bins = 15) +\n   facet_wrap(vars(truth), nrow = 2) +\n   xlab(\"Pr(Disease)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What do you think about its performance? What insights does this plot generate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that we can likely drop the threshold to somewhere about 25% without decreasing the specificity too much. This will allow you to detect more positive cases.\nOur model seems to be able to predict negative cases well. They mostly have low probabilities. However, you can see its poor performance with positive cases. They are spread pretty evenly across the full range of probabilities.

It should represent the expected distribution for the outcome, unaltered\n\n\n\n\n8.6.4 Up-sampling\n\nWe resample minority class observations with replacement within our training set to increase the number of total observations of the minority class in the training set.\nThis simply duplicates existing minority class observations\nOur test (or validation) set(s) should NOT be resampled. This is handled well by step_upsample()\n\n\nLet’s apply this in our example\n\nUp-sampling is part of feature engineering recipe\nNeed to specify the outcome (disease)\nCan set over_ratio to values other than 1 if desired\nMakes sense to do this after missing data imputation and dummy coding\nMakes sense to do this before normalizing features\nThese steps are in the themis package rather than recipes (can use namespace or load full library)\n\n\n\nCode\nrec_up &lt;- recipe(disease ~ ., data = data_trn) |&gt; \n  step_impute_median(all_numeric_predictors()) |&gt; \n  step_impute_mode(all_nominal_predictors()) |&gt;   \n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |&gt; \n  themis::step_upsample(disease, over_ratio = 1) |&gt; \n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())\n\n\n\nNeed to re-tune model b/c the sample size has changed\nNeed to refit the final model to all of train\n\n\nCode\nfits_glmnet_up &lt;- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    logistic_reg(penalty = tune(), \n                 mixture = tune()) |&gt; \n      set_engine(\"glmnet\") |&gt; \n      set_mode(\"classification\") |&gt; \n      tune_grid(preprocessor = rec_up, \n                resamples = splits_boot, grid = grid_glmnet, \n                metrics = metric_set(bal_accuracy))\n  },\n  rerun = rerun_setting,\n  dir = \"cache/008/\",\n  file = \"fit_glmnet_up\")\n\n\n\nReview hyperparameter plot\n\n\nCode\nplot_hyperparameters(fits_glmnet_up, hp1 = \"penalty\", hp2 = \"mixture\", metric = \"bal_accuracy\", log_hp1 = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s fit this best model configuration to all of our training data and evaluate it in test\n\nNote the use of NULL for new_data\nstep_upsample() is only applied to training/held-in but not held-out (truly new) data\nbake() knows to use the training data provided during prep() if we specify NULL\nCould have done this all along for baking training.

    "text": "Bias\n\nBias is a property of estimates “estimates” of a true population value. Sample statistics can be biased estimates of the population values for those statistics. Parameter estimates (e.g., from a linear model) can be biased estimates of the true population values for those parameters. And our models can be biased estimates of the true DGP for y. A model or other estimate is biased if it systematically over- or under-predicts the true population values that are being estimated overall or for some combination of inputs (e.g. features). Biased models are often described as “underfit” to the true DGP.\n\n\nsee also: underfit, overfit, variance; bias-variance trade-off\n\nBias-Variance trade-off\n\nThe error associated with our estimates of the DGP (i.e., prediction errors from our models) come from two sources: irreducible error and reducible error. Reducible error can be parsed into error due to bias and variance. As we seek to reduce the reduce the error from our models, we will often make changes to the model or the modeling process to reduce either the bias or variance of the fitted model. However, many of the changes we make to reduce bias often increase variance and many changes we make reduce variance often increase bias. Our goal is to make changes that produce bigger decreases in one of these sources of error than the often associated increase in the other.\n\n\nsee also: bias, variance\n\nCross-validation\n\ninsert definition\n\n\nsee also resampling, bootstrapping\n\nFeature\n\nFeatures are used as inputs to our model to make predictions for y. Feature engineering is the process of transforming our original predictors that we measure into the form that they will be input to our model. In some instances, our features may be exact copies of our predictors. But often, we transform the original features (e.g., power-transformations, dummy coding, missing data imputation) to allow them to better map onto the DGP for Y and reduce the error of our models.\n\n\nsynonyms: X, regressor, input\n\n\nsee also: predictor, independent variable\n\nHeld-out (data)set\n\ninsert definition\n\n\nsee also: Validation set, Test set\n\nHyperparameter\n\ninsert definition\n\n\nexamples include: k from KNN, lambda and alpha from elastic net (glmnet)\n\nModel configuration\n\ninsert definition\n\nPerformance metric\n\nA performance metric is a measure of model performance that allows us to judge the degree of error (or lack thereof) associated with our model’s predictions. Different performance metrics are used for regression vs. classification problems. For regression, we will often use root mean square error, mean (or median) absolute error, or \\(R^2\\). For classification, accuracy is the most well known but we will learn many other performance metrics including balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, auROC, and f-scores.\n\nPredictor\n\nThe initial (i.e., raw, original) variables that we collect/measure or manipulate in our studies and use to predict or explain our outcome (or dependent measure) are called predictors. If these predictors were manipulated in an experiment, we often call them independent variables. We use a process called feature engineering to transform the predictor variables from how they were initially measured in their final form as features (Xs, inputs) in our models.\n\n\nrelated concepts/terms: independent variable, feature, X, inputs, regressor, outcome, label\n\nResampling\n\nResampling is a process of creating multiple subsets of our full dataset. We often use resampling to get better performance estimates for our models than would be possible if we fit our models and estimated their performance in the sample (full) sample. There are two broad classes of resampling methods we will learn in this course: cross validation and bootstrapping. Cross validation itself is a class of resampling methods with many different variants (leave one out CV, K-fold CV, repeated K-fold CV, grouped K-fold CV, nested CV) that have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nsee also: Cross-validation, Bootstrapping\n\nTest set\n\ninsert definition\n\n\nsee also: Validation set, Test set\n\nTraining set\n\nA training set is a subset of our full data (obtained using a resampling method). We use training sets to fit various model configurations to develop our machine learning models. Model performance estimates based on training data are poor estimates of performance because our models are often overfit (sometimes by a large degree) to the training data. Therefore model performance estimates based on training data will generally overestimate how well our models will work with new data.\n\n\nsee also: validation set, test set, resampling, held-in set, held-out set\n\nValidation set\n\nA validation set is a subset of our full data (obtained using a resampling method). When we have several (or more, or many more) model configurations that we are considering, we use validation set(s) to calculate performance metrics to estimate the relative performance of these model configurations in new data. It is important to use validation sets for this purpose because evaluating our model configurations in training sets could lead us to select the configurations that are most overfit to the training data rather than the model configurations that are expect to perform best with new data that were not used to fit them.\n\n\nsee also: training set, test set, resampling, held-in set, held-out set\n\nVariance\n\ninsert definition\n\n\nsee also: overfit, bias-variance trade off, bias, underfit",

    "text": "General Information\nTo start, the introductory sections about PCA from Wikipedia provide a nice orientation and summary of the technique.\nIn short, PCA linearly transforms our data (our xs to be precise) onto a new coordinate system such that the directions/axes (principal components) capturing the largest variation in the data can be easily identified.\nA set of up to p principal components can be derived from p raw variables (e.g. predictors) such that the first principal component is a linear combination of the p raw variables that accounts for the most variance across those variables. The 2nd prinicipal component is a similar linear combination of the raw variables that is orthogonal (uncorrleated) with the first component and accounts for the largest proportionn of remaining variance among the raw variables. PCA continues to derive additional components that are each orthogonal to the previous components and account for successively less variance.\nThese new components represent a new coordinate system within which to represent score on our observations. This new system is a rotation of the original coordinate system that consists of orthogonal axes (e.g., x, y, z) defined by our raw variables.\nWe can use PCA to\n\nUnderstand the structure of our data\nTransform our raw (correlated) variables into a set of uncorrelated features\nMost importantly, retain a large portion of the the variance from the p original variables with &lt;&lt; p principal components. This last benefit may allow us to fit lower variance prediction models (due to less overfitting) without increasing model bias by much.\n\n\n\nApplications in machine learning\nWhen we discuss PCA in the machine learning world, we consider it an example of an unsupervised machine learning approach.\n\nIt is applied to the raw predictors (the xs, ignoring y).\n\nWe use it to reduce the dimensionality of our features to minimize overfitting that can contribute to model variance.",

    "section": "A Two Dimensional Example",
    "text": "A Two Dimensional Example\nThis example is based loosely on a tutorial and demonstration data developed by Lindsay Smith\nFor a second example that extends to 3D space, see this website\n\nLet’s start with a toy dataset for two variables (e.g., predictors), x1 and x2 and a sample size of 10. We will work in two dimensions to make the example easier to visualize but the generalization to p dimensions (where p = number of variables) is not difficult.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nd &lt;- tibble(x1 = c(2.5, 0.5, 2.2, 1.9, 3.1, 2.3, 2.0, 1.0, 1.5, 1.1),\n            x2 = c(2.4, 0.7, 2.9, 2.2, 3.0, 2.7, 1.6, 1.1, 1.6, 0.9))\nd |&gt; print()\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n      x1    x2\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1   2.5   2.4\n 2   0.5   0.7\n 3   2.2   2.9\n 4   1.9   2.2\n 5   3.1   3  \n 6   2.3   2.7\n 7   2     1.6\n 8   1     1.1\n 9   1.5   1.6\n10   1.1   0.9\n\n\n\nHere is a scatterplot of the dataset. I’ve also added a green dot (that is not part of the dataset) at the mean of x1 and x2. This will be the point of rotation for the dataset as we attempt to find a new coordinate system (not defined by x1 and x2), where the dataset’s variance is maximized across the new axes (the principal components) and the observations are uncorrelated in this new coordinate system.\n\n\nCode\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\nd |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = x2)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = tibble(x1=mean(d$x1), x2 = mean(d$x2)), \n             size = 2, color = \"green\") +\n  xlim(-1,4) +\n  ylim(-1,4) +\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in the process is to center both x1 and x2 such that their means are zero. This moves the green point to the origin. This will make it easier to rotate the data around that point (the definitions of the new principal components will be defined as a linear combination of the original variables but there is not offset/intercept in those transformation formulas).\nI’ve left the green point at the mean of x1c and x2c for this plot to reinforce the impact of centering. I will remove it from later figures. I have also drawn the true axes in blue to make the original coordinate system defined by x1 and x2 salient. PCA will rotate this coordinate system to achieve its goals.\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- d |&gt; \n  mutate(x1c = x1 - mean(x1), x2c = x2 - mean(x2))\n\nplot &lt;- d |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x1c, y = x2c)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"blue\") +\n    xlim(-2.5, 2.5) +\n    ylim(-2.5, 2.5) +\n    coord_fixed()\n\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = tibble(x1c=mean(d$x1c), x2c = mean(d$x2c)), \n               size = 2, color = \"green\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is sometimes useful to also scale the original variables (i.e.,, set their standard deviations = 1).\n\nThis may be important if the variables have very difference variances.\nIf you dont scale the variables, the variables with the large variances will have more influence on the rotation than those with smaller variances.\n\nIf this is not desirable, scale the variables as well as center them.\n\nHowever, do know that sometimes variances are larger because of noise and if you scale, you will magnify that noise.\n\n\nOur goal now is to find the axes of the new coordinate system. The first axis (the first principal component) will be situated such it maximizes the variance in the data across its span. Imagine fittinng all possible lines through the green dot and choosing the line that moves along the widest spread of the data. That line (displayed in green below) will be the first axis of the new coordinate system and projections of the points onto that axis will represent the scores for each observation on our first principal component defined by this axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis axis associated with the first principal component is similar to a regression line but not identical.\n\nThe red regression line (below) was fit to minimize the sum of the squared errors when predicting the outcome (in this instance when regressing x2c on x1c) from a predictor (in this instance, x1c. These errors are the vertical distances from the red line to the points.\nIn contrast, the green line maximized variance across that PC1 dimension. As a result, it also minimized deviations around the line. However, thsee deviations are the squared perpendicular distances between the green line and the points. These distances go up and to the left and down and to the right from the green line to the points rather than vertical. They are not the same line!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the next principal component, we need to find a new axis that is perpendicular to the first component and in the direction that accounts for the largest proportion of the remaining variance in the dataset.\nIn our example with only two variables, there is only one direction remaining that is perpendicular/orthogonal with PC1 because we are in two dimensional space given only two original variables.\nHowever, if we were in a higher dimensional space with p &gt; 2 variables, this next component could follow the direction of maximal remaining variance in a direction orthogonal to PC1. Subsequent components up to the pth component given p variables would each be orthogonal to all previous components and in the direction of maximal variance.\nWe have added this second component (orange) to our 2 dimensional example below.\n\n\nCoordinate system already present. Adding new coordinate system, which will\nreplace the existing one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two components define a new coordinate system within which to measure/score our observations. The new axes of this system are the PCs. This new coordinate system is a rotation of our original system that was previously defined in axes based on x1 and x2.\nHere is a figure displaying the data in this new coordinate system. Notice the group of four points to the left (three vertical and one further to the left). Those same points were previously in the top right quadrant of the coordinate system defined by x1c and x2c.\n\nScores on each of the two components are obtained by projecting the observations onto the associated axis for that component.\nThe data show the highest variance over PC1 (the x axis) and the next highest variance over PC2 (the y axis)\nWhen the observations are scored/defined on these PCs, PC1 and PC2 are now new, uncorrelated features we can use to describe the data.",

This can be solved with the function keras::use_condaenv(), where the obligatory argument of this function is a path to the miniconda environment you created in step 4. Alternatively, you can use keras::use_python() where instead you provide the path to the specific version of python within the miniconda installed in step 4. The challenge is finding the path to put as the first argument to either of these functions. If this comes up and you need help, reach out to the TAs and John.",

    "section": "Mac OS",
    "text": "Mac OS\nThe steps below will allow Mac users to install keras in R and the backend software to support fitting neural networks in R. Ideally, get your installation going well in advance of the homework being released so that you can hit the ground running on this unit. Also note that Linux users can follow this tutorial and everything should work out fine because of the similarity between Linux and MacOS (UNIX and UNIX-like systems).\n\nFirst thing: Check your processor\nThe first thing to do is determine the type of processor you have on your computer. Go to the Apple icon in the upper left of your screen and select “About this Mac”. In the window that pops up one of the lines will show your “Processor”. It will either tell you that you have some type of Intel processor, or (importantly) it will tell you that you have an “M1” or “M2” processor. If you have an M1 or M2 (or other M) processor, check that you have the proper version of R installed on your machine for the M-class processors by typing R.version in the console in RStudio. For Macs with the M-class processor (M1 or M2) you need to have a distribution of R identified with the arm64 (64-bit Advanced RISC Machines) in the version name. If your version of R isn’t identified in this way, you need to re-install R with the appropriate arm64 distribution from CRAN before proceeding to install the necessary modeling libraries for using neural networks in R with the python backend. If you don’t, it will not work to install these libraries and you won’t be able to do the work in this unit. We’ve found that it is better to check for this before you try to install keras and related libraries in R because the wrong distribution of R will cause you problems once you move on to install keras. If you have an M1 or M2 processor and you have the proper version of R installed for that machinery, you can move on to the steps below outlining how to install keras in R. For related issues that arise after installing the proper version of R for M-class processors, see the “Common problems” section below. Sometimes additional issues arise beyond the R version problem.\nAlternatively, if you have an Intel processor, you shouldn’t encounter problems and you can move on to step 1 below for Install keras in R\n\n\nInstall keras in R\n\nOpen RStudio\nTo install keras in R, type install.packages(\"keras\") in the console\nThen load the library by typing library(keras) in the console\n\n\n\nInstall backend python and libraries\n\nIn order to run keras you then need to install the backend. Run install_keras(). This should prompt you to install Miniconda. This is a distribution of the python language and a number of libraries, including tensorflow and keras, all of which we need to run ANNs. If you are comfortable installing this software, select Yes/Y. This installation process may take a few minutes, and will result in about 6GB of disk space used.\nRestart R session (Session &gt; Restart R from the menu)\n\n\n\nTest the backend\n\nLoad the keras library by typing (library(keras)) in the console\nTo see if the backend installed, type backend() in the console. [Details: This function should provide some information about tensorflow as your backend library to keras. If it provides you something like Module(tensorflow_core.keras.backend) or Module(keras.api._v2.keras.backend), then you should be good. If it doesn’t, or if it provides a warning or error that suggests that tensorflow was not installed, reach out to the TAs and John for help.]\n\n\n\nCommon problems\nIf keras in R won’t install, then you either need to try again with a fresh install (starting from the top of this tutorial), or you need to point R to a proper installation of keras/tensorflow on your machine. Most commonly, this would be done with another conda distribution of python (other than the one that keras installs for you) that you install yourself outside of R. It could be that you already have another conda distribution of python installed if you’ve used python in other work/ courses. If you get to this point, you will likely need the support of an instructor, so reach out and they can help. Nonetheless, the important details to consider are discussed below.\nIf the R installation of keras doesn’t work and you need to install keras in a different conda environment than the one R installs for you, then (once you install keras in that other environment) you need to specify the correct distribution of python (i.e., the one associated with the correct conda environment) on your machine for use in keras in R. The “correct” one is the one that has a successfully installed version of tensorflow and keras. Most likely, if this is a problem, it is due to the fact that your Mac has an M1 or M2 processor. This is an idiosyncratic case because these processors sometimes require a version of tensorflow/keras that isn’t the version automatically installed when you use keras::install_keras() in R. You’ll know if this is the case if you try to complete the installation steps above using keras::install_keras() in R and problems arise (i.e., R tells you that keras and/or tensorflow weren’t properly installed).\nIn order to point R to another version of conda/python on your machine (assuming you’ve installed one), use the function keras::use_python(). Here, the obligatory argument of this function is a path to the miniconda python distribution that contains the successful installation of tensorflow and keras. Calling this function will need to be done at the top of any scripts where you intend to use keras in R. This would look something like use_python(\"/Users/johncurtin/miniconda3/bin/python\"). The challenge in using this function is finding this path to put as the first argument. If this comes up and you need help, reach out to the instructors.\nFor more on this and related methods of sourcing specific versions of python from within R see this page from the reticulate package. Note that reticulate is the package in R that supports the keras implementation, and is automatically installed when you install keras in R. Many reticulate functions are inherited by keras such that you can call the same function (with the same name) in keras or in reticulate from within R and have the same outcome (e.g., keras::use_python() is equivalent to reticulate::use_python()).\nThe other common issue concerns the M-class processor and your version of R, described above - so follow that suggestion if it applies to you. If you’ve gotten this far, hopefully you’ve read through that issue already.",
