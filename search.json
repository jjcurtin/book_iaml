    "text": "Instructor\nJohn Curtin\n\nOffice hours: Thursdays, 3-4 pm or by appointment in Brogden 326\nEmail: jjcurtin@wisc.edu (but please use Slack DM or channel posts for all course communications during this semester)\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistants\nZihan Li\n\nOffice hours: Mondays, 1-2 pm in Brogden 617 or by appointment\nEmail: zli2545@wisc.edu\n\nCoco Yu\n\nOffice hours: Wednesday, 11 - 12 pm in Brodgen 325 or by appointment\nEmail: jyu274@wisc.edu\n\n\n\nCourse Website\nhttps://jjcurtin.github.io/book_iaml/\n\n\nCommunications\nAll course communications will occur in the course’s Slack workspace (https://iaml-2025.slack.com/). You should have received an invitation to join the workspace. If you have difficulty joining, please contact me by my email above. The TAs and I will respond to all Slack messages within 1 business day (and often much quicker). Please plan accordingly (e.g., weekend messages may not receive a response until Monday). For general questions about class, coding assignments, etc., please post the question to the appropriate public channel. If you have the question, you are probably not alone. For issues relevant only to you (e.g., class absences, accommodations, etc.), you can send a direct message in Slack to me. However, I may share the DM with the TAs unless you request otherwise. In general, we prefer that all course communication occur within Slack rather than by email so that it is centralized in one location.\n\n\nMeeting Times\nThe scheduled course meeting times are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 - 12:15 pm. Tuesdays are generally used by the TAs for lab to discuss application issues from the homework or in the course more generally. Thursdays are generally led by John and used to discuss topics from the video lectures and readings.\nAll required videos, readings, and application assignments are described on the course website at the beginning of each unit.\n\n\nCourse Description\nThis course is designed to introduce students to a variety of computational approaches in machine learning. The course is designed with two key foci. First, students will focus on the application of common, “out-of-the-box” statistical learning algorithms that have good performance and are implemented in tidymodels in R. Second, students will focus on the application of these approaches in the context of common questions in behavioral science in academia and industry.\n\n\nRequisites\nStudents are required to have completed Psychology 610 with a grade of B or better or a comparable course with my consent.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nStudents will develop and refine best practices for data wrangling, general programming, and analysis in R.\nStudents will distinguish among a variety of machine learning settings: supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning, regression vs. classification\nStudents will be able to implement a broad toolbox of well-supported machine-learning methods: decision trees, nearest neighbor, general and generalized linear models, penalized models including ridge, lasso, and elastic-nets, neural nets, random forests.\nStudents will develop expertise with common feature extraction techniques for quantitative and categorical predictors.\nStudents will be able to use natural language processing approaches to extract meaningful features from text data.\nStudents will know how to characterize how well their regression and classification models perform and they will employ appropriate methodology for evaluating their: cross validation, ROC and PR curves, hypothesis testing.\nStudents will learn to apply their skills to common learning problems in psychology and behavioral sciences more generally.\n\n\n\nCourse Topics\n\nOverview of Machine Learning Concepts and Uses\nData wrangling in R using tidyverse and tidymodels\nIterations, functions, simulations in R\nRegression models\nClassification models\nModel performance metrics\nROCs\nCross validation and other resampling methods\nModel selection and regularization\nApproaches to parallel processing\nFeature engineering techniques\nNatural language processing\nTree based methods\nBagging and boosting\nNeural networks\nDimensionality reduction and feature selection\nExplanatory methods including variable importance, partial dependence plots, etc\nEthics and privacy issues\n\n\n\nSchedule\nThe course is organized around 14 weeks of academic instruction covering the following topics:\n\nIntroduction to course and machine learning\nExploratory data analysis\nRegression models\nClassification models\nResampling methods for model selection and evaluation\nRegularization and penalized models\nMidterm exam/project\nAdvanced performance metrics\nModel comparisons\nAdvanced models: Random forests and ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, stacking)\nAdvanced models: Neural networks\nNatural Language Processing I: Text processing and feature engineering\nApplications\nEthics\n\n\nThe final exam is during exam week on Tuesday May 6th from 11 - 12:15 in our normal classroom.\nThe final project is due during exam week on Friday May 9th at 8 pm.\n\n\n\nRequired Textbooks and Software\nAll required textbooks are freely available online (though hard copies can also be purchased if desired). There are eight required textbooks for the course. The primary text for which we will read many chapters is:\n\nJames, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R (2023; 2nd Edition). (website)\n\nWe will also read sections to chapters in each of the following texts:\n\nWickham, H. & Grolemund, G.

It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.\n\n\nGrading\n\nQuizzes (13 anticipated): 15%\nApplication assignments (11 anticipated): 25%\nMidterm application exam: 15%\nMidterm conceptual exam: 15%\nFinal application exam: 15%\nFinal conceptual exam: 15%\n\nFinal letter grades may be curved upward, but a minimum guarantee is made of an A for 93 or above, AB for 88 - 92, B for 83 - 87, BC for 78 - 82, C for 70 - 77, D for 60-69, and F for &lt; 60.\n\n\nExams, Application Assignments and Quizzes\n\nThe midterm application exam will be due during the 7th week of the course on Wednesday, March 5th at 8 pm.\nThe midterm conceptual exam will be administered during class on Thursday, March 6th.\nThe final exam is during exam week on Tuesday May 6th from 11 - 12:15 in our normal classroom.\nThe final project is due during exam week on Friday May 9th at 8 pm.\nApproximately weekly quizzes will be administered through Canvas and due each Wednesday at 8 pm\nApproximately weekly application assignments will be submitted via Canvas and due each Wednesday at 8 pm.\n\n\n\nApplication Assignments\nThe approximately weekly application assignments are due on Wednesdays at 8 pm through Canvas. These assignments are to be done individually. Please do not share answers or code. You are also encouraged to make use of online resources (e.g., stack overflow) for assistance. All assignments will be completed using R markdown to provide both the code and documentation as might be provided to your mentor or employer to fully describe your solution. Late assignments are not accepted because problem solutions are provided immediately after the due date. Application assignments are graded on a three-point scale (0 = not completed, 1 = partially completed and/or with many errors, 2 = fully completed and at least mostly correct). Grades for each assignment will be posted by the following Monday at the latest.\n\n\nChatGPT\nI suspect you have all seen discussions of all that ChatGPT can do by now and its impact on teaching and assessment. I believe that AI like ChatGPT will eventually become an incredible tool for data scientists and programmers. As such, I view these advances with excitement. Of course, I don’t plan to assign a grade to ChatGPT so I want to make sure that we are clear on when you can and when you cannot use it. Given that I expect AI like ChatGPT to become a useful tool in our workflow as professionals, now is the time to start to learn how it can help. Therefore, you are free to use it during any of our application assignments AND the application questions on the mid-term and final exams. Code from ChatGPT is unlikely to be sufficient in either context (and my testing suggests it can be flat out wrong in some instances!) but I suspect that it will still be useful. In contrast, you CANNOT use ChatGPT to answer the conceptual questions on the two exams or the weekly quizzes. Those questions are designed to assess your working knowledge about concepts and best practices. That information must be in YOUR head and I want to be 100% clear that use of ChatGPT to answer those questions will be considered cheating and handled as such if detected. There will be a zero tolerance policy for such cheating. It will be reported to the Dean of Students on first offense.\n\n\nStudent Ethics\nThe members of the faculty of the Department of Psychology at UW-Madison uphold the highest ethical standards of teaching and research. They expect their students to uphold the same standards of ethical conduct. By registering for this course, you are implicitly agreeing to conduct yourself with the utmost integrity throughout the semester.\nIn the Department of Psychology, acts of academic misconduct are taken very seriously. Such acts diminish the educational experience for all involved – students who commit the acts, classmates who would never consider engaging in such behaviors, and instructors. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, cheating on assignments and exams, stealing exams, sabotaging the work of classmates, submitting fraudulent data, plagiarizing the work of classmates or published and/or online sources, acquiring previously written papers and submitting them (altered or unaltered) for course assignments, collaborating with classmates when such collaboration is not authorized, and assisting fellow students in acts of misconduct. Students who have knowledge that classmates have engaged in academic misconduct should report this to the instructor.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nInstitutional statement on diversity: “Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.” https://diversity.wisc.edu/\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nBy enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UW-Madison’s community of scholars in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest academic integrity standards. Academic misconduct compromises the integrity of the university. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these acts are examples of academic misconduct, which can result in disciplinary action. This includes but is not limited to failure on the assignment/course, disciplinary probation, or suspension. Substantial or repeated cases of misconduct will be forwarded to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for additional review. For more information, refer to http://studentconduct.wiscweb.wisc.edu/academic-integrity\n\n\nAccommodations Polices\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center syllabus statement: “The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty [me] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty [I], will work either directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student’s educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.” http://mcburney.wisc.edu/facstaffother/faculty/syllabus.php\nUW-Madison students who have experienced sexual misconduct (which can include sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and/or stalking) also have the right to request academic accommodations. This right is afforded them under Federal legislation (Title IX). Information about services and resources (including information about how to request accommodations) is available through Survivor Services, a part of University Health Services: https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/survivor-services/\n\n\nComplaints\nOccasionally, a student may have a complaint about a TA or course instructor. If that happens, you should feel free to discuss the matter directly with the TA or instructor. If the complaint is about the TA and you do not feel comfortable discussing it with the individual, you should discuss it with the course instructor. Complaints about mistakes in grading should be resolved with the TA and/or instructor in the great majority of cases. If the complaint is about the instructor (other than ordinary grading questions) and you do not feel comfortable discussing it with the individual, make an appointment to speak to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies, Professor Shawn Green, cshawngreen@wisc.edu.\nIf you have concerns about climate or bias in this class, or if you wish to report an incident of bias or hate that has occurred in class, you may contact the Chair of the Department, Professor Allyson Bennett (allyson.j.bennett@wisc.edu) or the Chair of the Psychology Department Climate & Diversity Committee, Martha Alibali (martha.alibali@wisc.edu). You may also use the University’s bias incident reporting system\n\n\nPrivacy of Student Information & Digital Tools\nThe privacy and security of faculty, staff and students’ personal information is a top priority for UW-Madison. The university carefully reviews and vets all campus-supported digital tools used to support teaching and learning, to help support success through learning analytics, and to enable proctoring capabilities. UW-Madison takes necessary steps to ensure that the providers of such tools prioritize proper handling of sensitive data in alignment with FERPA, industry standards and best practices.\nUnder the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA which protects the privacy of student education records), student consent is not required for the university to share with school officials those student education records necessary for carrying out those university functions in which they have legitimate educational interest. 34 CFR 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B). FERPA specifically allows universities to designate vendors such as digital tool providers as school officials, and accordingly to share with them personally identifiable information from student education records if they perform appropriate services for the university and are subject to all applicable requirements governing the use, disclosure and protection of student data.\n\n\nPrivacy of Student Records & the Use of Audio Recorded Lectures\nSee information about privacy of student records and the usage of audio-recorded lectures.\nLecture materials and recordings for this course are protected intellectual property at UW-Madison. Students in this course may use the materials and recordings for their personal use related to participation in this class. Students may also take notes solely for their personal use. If a lecture is not already recorded, you are not authorized to record my lectures without my permission unless you are considered by the university to be a qualified student with a disability requiring accommodation. [Regent Policy Document 4-1] Students may not copy or have lecture materials and recordings outside of class, including posting on internet sites or selling to commercial entities. Students are also prohibited from providing or selling their personal notes to anyone else or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the instructor’s express written permission. Unauthorized use of these copyrighted lecture materials and recordings constitutes copyright infringement and may be addressed under the university’s policies, UWS Chapters 14 and 17, governing student academic and non-academic misconduct.\n\n\nAcademic Calendar & Religious Observances\nStudents who wish to inquire about religious observance accommodations for exams or assignments should contact the instructor within the first two weeks of class, following the university’s policy on religious observance conflicts",

    "section": "2.3 More Details on Supervised Techniques",
    "text": "2.3 More Details on Supervised Techniques\nFor supervised machine learning problems, we assume \\(Y\\) (outcome) is a function of some data generating process (DGP, \\(f\\)) involving a set of Xs (features) plus the addition of random error (\\(\\epsilon\\)) that is independent of X and with mean of 0\n\\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\)\n\nTerminology sidebar: Throughout the course we will distinguish between the raw predictors available in a dataset and the features that are derived from those raw predictors through various transformations.\n\nWe estimate \\(f\\) (the DGP) for two main reasons: prediction and/or inference (i.e., explanation per Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017)\n\\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\)\nFor prediction, we are most interested in the accuracy of \\(\\hat{Y}\\) and typically treat \\(\\hat{f}\\) as a black box\nFor inference, we are typically interested in the way that \\(Y\\) is affected by \\(X\\)\n\nWhich predictors are associated with \\(Y\\)?\nWhich are the strongest/most important predictors of \\(Y\\)\nWhat is the relationship between the outcome and the features associated with each predictor. Is the overall relationship between a predictor and \\(Y\\) positive, negative, dependent on other predictors? What is the shape of relationship (e.g., linear or more complex)?\nDoes the model as a whole improve prediction beyond a null model (no features from predictors) or beyond a compact model?\nWe care about good (low error) predictions even when we care about inference (we want small \\(\\epsilon\\))\n\nThey will also be tested with low power\nParameter estimates from models that don’t predict well may be incorrect or at least imprecise\n\n\n\nModel error includes both reducible and irreducible error.\nIf we consider both \\(X\\) and \\(\\hat{f}\\) to be fixed, then:\n\n\\(E(Y - \\hat{Y})^2 = (f(X) + \\epsilon - \\hat{f}(X))^2\\)\n\\(E(Y - \\hat{Y})^2 = [f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2 + Var(\\epsilon)\\)\n\n\\(Var(\\epsilon)\\) is irreducible\n\nIrreducible error results from other important \\(X\\) that we fail to measure and from measurement error in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nIrreducible error serves as an (unknown) bounds for model accuracy (without collecting additional Xs)\n\n\\([f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2\\) is reducible\n\nReducible error results from a mismatch between \\(\\hat{f}\\) and the true \\(f\\)\nThis course will focus on techniques to estimate \\(f\\) with the goal of minimizing reducible error\n\n\n\n2.3.1 How Do We Estimate \\(f\\)?\n\nWe need a sample of \\(N\\) observations of \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) that we will call our training set\nThere are two types of statistical algorithms that we can use for \\(\\hat{f}\\):\n\nParametric algorithms\nNon-parametric algorithms\n\n\n\nParametric algorithms:\n\nFirst, make an assumption about the functional form or shape of \\(f\\).\n\nFor example, the general linear model assumes: \\(f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X2 + ... + \\beta_p*X_p\\)\nNext, a model using that algorithm is fit to the training set. In other words, the parameter estimates (e.g., \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1\\)) are derived to minimize some cost function (e.g., mean squared error for the linear model)\nParametric algorithms reduce the problem of estimating \\(f\\) down to one of only estimating some set of parameters for a chosen model\nParametric algorithms often yield more interpretable models\nBut they are often not very flexible. If you chose the wrong algorithm (shape for \\(\\hat{f}\\) that does not match \\(f\\)) the model will not fit well in the training set (and more importantly not in the new test set either)\n\nTerminology sidebar: A training set is a subset of your full dataset that is used to fit a model. In contrast, a validation set is a subset that has not been included in the training set and is used to select a best model from among competing model configurations. A test set is a third subset of the full dataset that has not been included in either the training or validation sets and is used for evaluating the performance of your fitted final/best model.\n\nNon-parametric algorithms:\n\nDo not make any assumption about the form/shape of \\(f\\)\nCan fit well for a wide variety of forms/shapes for \\(f\\)\nThis flexibility comes with costs\n\nThey generally require larger \\(N\\) in the training set than parametric algorithms to achieve comparable performance\nThey may overfit the training set. This happens when they begin to fit the noise in the training set. This will yield low error in training set but much higher error in new validation or test sets.\nThey are often less interpretable\n\n\n\nGenerally:\n\nFlexibility and interpretability are inversely related\nModels need to be flexible enough to fit \\(f\\) well\nAdditional flexibility beyond this can produce overfitting\nParametric algorithms are generally less flexible than non-parametric algorithms\nParametric algorithms can become more flexible by increasing the number of features (\\(p\\) from 610/710; e.g., using more predictors, more complex, non-linear forms to when deriving features from predictors)\nParametric algorithms can be made less flexible through regularization. There are techniques to make some non-parametric algorithms less flexible as well\nYou want the sweet spot for prediction. You may want even less flexible for inference in increase interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 How Do We Assess Model Performance?\nThere is no universally best statistical algorithm\n\nDepends on the true \\(f\\) and your goal (prediction or inference)\nWe often compare multiple statistical algorithms (various parametric and non-parametric options) and model configurations more generally (combinations of different algorithms with different sets of features)\nWhen comparing models/configurations, we need to both fit these models and then select the best one\n\n\nBest needs to be defined with respect to some performance metric in new (validation or test set) data\n\nThere are many performance metrics you might use\nRoot Mean squared error (RMSE) is common for regression problems\nAccuracy is common for classification problems\n\nWe will learn many other performance metrics in a later unit\n\nTwo types of performance problems are typical\n\nModels are underfit if they don’t adequately represent the true \\(f\\), typically because they have oversimplied the relationship (e.g., linear function fit to quadratic DGP, missing key interaction terms)\n\nUnderfit models will yield biased predictions. In other words, they will systematically either under-predict or over-predict \\(Y\\) in some regions of the function.\nBiased models will perform poorly in both training and test sets\n\nModels are overfit if they are too flexible and begin to fit the noise in the training set.\n\nOverfit models will perform well (too well actually) in the training set but poorly in test or validation sets\nThey will show high variance such that the model and its predictions change drastically depending on the training set where it is fit\n\n\n\nMore generally, these problems and their consequences for model performance are largely inversely related\n\nThis is known as the Bias-Variance trade-off\nWe previously discussed reducible and irreducible error\n\nReducible error can be parsed into components due to bias and variance\nGoal is to minimize the sum of bias and variance error (i.e., the reducible error overall)\nWe will often trade off a little bias if it provides a big reduction in variance\n\n\nBut before we dive further into the Bias-Variance trade-off, lets review some key terminology that we will use throughout this course.",

    "text": "2.4 Key Terminology in Context\nIn the following pages:\n\nWe will present the broad steps for developing and evaluating machine learning models\nWe will situate key terms in this context (along with other synonymous terms used by others) and highlight them in bold.\n\nMachine learning has emerged in parallel from developments in statistics and computer science.\n\nAs a result, there is a lot of terminology and often multiple terms used for the same concept. This is not my fault!\n\nI will try to use one set of terms, but you need to be familiar with other terms you will encounter\n\n\nWhen developing a supervised machine learning model to predict or explain an outcome (also called DV, label, output):\n\nOur goal is for the model to match as close as possible (given the limits due to irreducible error) the true data generating process for Y.\nWe typically consider multiple (often many) candidate model configurations to achieve this goal.\n\n\nCandidate model configurations can vary with respect to:\n\nthe statistical algorithm used\nthe algorithm’s hyperparameters\nthe features used in the model to predict the outcome\n\n\nStatistical algorithms can be coarsely categorized as parametric or non-parametric.\nBut we will mostly focus on a more granular description of the specific algorithm itself\nExamples of specific statistical algorithms we will learn in this course include the linear model, generalized linear model, elastic net, LASSO, ridge regression, neural networks, KNN, random forest.\n\nThe set of candidate model configurations often includes variations of the same statistical algorithm with different hyperparameter (also called tuning parameter) values that control aspects of the algorithm’s operation.\n\nExamples include \\(k\\) in the KNN algorithm and \\(lambda\\) in LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net algorithms.\nWe will learn more about hyperparameters and their effects later in this course.\n\n\nThe set of candidate model configurations can vary with respect to the features that are included.\n\nA recipe describes how to transform raw data for predictors (also called IVs) into features (also called regressors, inputs) that are included in the feature matrix (also called design matrix, model matrix).\n\nThis process of transforming predictors into features in a feature matrix is called feature engineering.\n\n\nCrossing variation on statistical algorithms, hyperparameter values, and alternative sets of features can increase the number of candidate model configurations dramatically\n\ndeveloping a machine learning model can easily involve fitting thousands of model configurations.\nIn most implementations of machine learning, the number of candidate model configurations nearly ensures that some fitted models will overfit the dataset in which they are developed such that they capitalize on noise that is unique to the dataset in which they were fit.\n\nFor this reason, model configurations are assessed and selected on the basis of their relative performance for new data (observations that were not involved in the fitting process).\n\n\nWe have ONE full dataset but we use resampling techniques to form subsets of that dataset to enable us to assess models’ performance in new data.\nCross-validation and bootstrapping are both examples of classes of resampling techniques that we will learn in this course.\nBroadly, resampling techniques create multiple subsets that consist of random samples of the full dataset. These different subsets can be used for model fitting, model selection, and model evaluation.\n\nTraining sets are subsets that are used for model fitting (also called model training). During model fitting, models with each candidate model configuration are fit to the data in the training set. For example, during fitting, model parameters are estimated for regression algorithms, and weights are established for neural network algorithms. Some non-parametric algorithms, like k-nearest neighbors, do not estimate parameters but simply “memorize” the training sets for subsequent predictions.\nValidation sets are subsets that are used for model selection (or, more accurately, for model configuration selection). During model selection, each (fitted) model — one for every candidate model configuration — is used to make predictions for observations in a validation set that, importantly, does not overlap with the model’s training set. On the basis of each model’s performance in the validation set, the relatively best model configuration (i.e., the configuration of the model that performs best relative to all other model configurations) is identified and selected. If you have only one model configuration, validation set(s) are not needed because there is no need to select among model configurations.\nTest sets are subsets that are used for model evaluation. Generally, a model with the previously identified best configuration is re-fit to all available data other than the test set. This fitted model is used to predict observations in the test set to estimate how well this model is expected to perform for new observations.\n\n\nThere are three broad steps to develop and evaluate a machine learning model:\n\nFitting models with multiple candidate model configurations (in training set(s))\nAssessing each model to select the best configuration (in validation set(s))\nEvaluating how well a model with that best configuration will perform with new observations (in test sets(s))",

    "text": "2.5 An Example of the Bias-Variance Trade-off\n\n2.5.1 Overview of Example\nThe concepts of underfitting vs. overfitting and the bias-variance trade-off are critical to understand\n\nIt is also important to understand how model flexibility can affect both the bias and variance of that model’s performance\nIt can help to make these abstract concepts concrete by exploring real models that are fit in actual data\nWe will conduct a very simple simulation to demonstrate these concepts\n\nThe code in this example is secondary to understanding the concepts of underfittinng, overfitting, bias, variance, and the bias-variance trade-off\n\nWe will not display much of it so that you can maintain focus on the concepts\nYou will have plenty of time to learn the underlying\n\n\nWhen modeling, our goal is typically to approximate the data generating process (DGP) as close as possible, but in the real world we never know the true DGP.\nA key advantage of many simulations is that we do know the DGP because we define it ourselves.\n\nFor example, in this simulation, we know that \\(Y\\) is a cubic function of \\(X\\) and noise (random error).\nIn fact, we know the exact equation for calculating \\(Y\\) as a function of \\(X\\).\n\n\\(y = 1100 - 4.0 * x - 0.4 * x^2 + 0.1 * (x - h)^3 + noise\\), where:\n\nb0 = 1100\nb1 = -4.0\nb2 = -0.4\nb3 = 0.1\nh = -20.0\nnoise has mean = 0 and sd = 150\n\n\n\nWe will attempt to model this cubic DGP with three different model configurations\n\nA simple linear model that uses only \\(X\\) as a feature\nA (20th order) polynomial linear model that uses 20 polynomials of \\(X\\) as features\nA (20th order) polynomial LASSO model that uses the same 20 polynomials of \\(X\\) as features but “regularizes” to remove unimportant features from the model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: If the DGP for y is a cubic function of x, what do we know about the expected bias for our three candidate model configurations in this example?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple linear model will underfit the true DGP and therefore it will be biased b/c it can only represent Y as a linear function of X.\nThe two polynomial models will be generally unbiased b/c they have X represented with 20th order polynomials.\nLASSO will be slightly biased due to regularization but more on that in a later unit.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Stimulation Steps\nWith that introduction complete, lets start our simulation of the bias-variance trade-off\n\nLets simulate four separate research teams, each working to estimate the DGP for Y\n\n\nEach team will get their own random sample of training data (N = 100) to fit models\n\nHere are plots of these four simulated training sets (one for each team) with a dotted line for the data generating process (DGP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get one more large random sample (N = 5000) with the same DGP to use as a test set to evaluate all the models that will be fit in the separate training sets across the four teams.\n\n\nWe will let each team use this same test set to keep things simple\nThe key is that the test set contains new observations not present in any of the training sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the four teams fit their three model configurations in their training sets\nThey use the resulting models to make predictions for observations in the same training set in which they were fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you see evidence of bias for any model configuration? Look in any training set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple linear model is clearly biased. It systemically underestimates Y in some portions of the X distribution and overestimates Y in other portions of the X distribution. This is true across training sets for all teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you see any evidence of overfitting for any model configuration?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe polynomial linear model appears to overfit the data in the training set. In other words, it seems to follow both the signal/DGP and the noise. However, in practice none of the teams could not be certain of this with only their training set.\nIt is possible that the wiggles in the prediction line represent the real DGP. They need to look at the model’s performance in the test set to be certain about the degree of overfitting. (Of course, we know because these are simulated data and we know the DGP.)\n\n\n\n\nNow the teams use their 3 trained models to make predictions for new observations in the test set\n\n\nRemember that the test set has NEW observations of X and Y that weren’t used for fitting any of the models.\nLets look at each model configuration’s performance in test separately\n\n\n\nHere are predictions from the four simple linear models (fit in the training sets for each team) in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you see evidence of bias for the simple linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, consistent with what we saw in the training sets, the simple linear model systematically overestimates Y in some places and underestimates it in others. The DGP is clearly NOT linear but this simple model can only make linear predictions. It is a fairly biased model that underfits the true DGP. This bias will make a large contribution to the reducible error of the model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How much variance across the simple linear models is present?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not much variance in the prediction lines across the models that were fit by different teams in different training sets. The slopes are very close across the different team’s models and the intercepts only vary by a small amount. The simple linear model configuration does not appear to have high variance (across teams) and therefore model variance will not contribute much to its reducible error.\n\n\n\n\nHere are predictions from the polynomial linear models from the four teams in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Are these polynomial models systematically biased?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not much systematic bias. The overall function is generally cubic for all four teams - just like the DGP. Bias will not contribute much to the model’s reducible error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does the variance of these polynomial models compare to the variance of the simple linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is much higher model variance for this polynomial linear model relative to the simple linear model. Although all four models generally predict Y as a cubic function of X, there is also a non-systematic wiggle that is different for each team’s models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does this demonstrate the connection between model overfitting and model variance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel variance (across teams) is a result of overfitting to the training set. If a model fits noise in its training set, that noise will be different in every dataset. Therefore, you end up with different models depending on the training set in which they are fit. And none of those models will do well with new data as you can see in this test set because noise is random and different in each dataset.\n\n\n\n\nHere are predictions from the polynomial LASSO models from each team in the test set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does their bias compare to the simple and polynomial linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LASSO models have low bias much like the polynomial linear model. They are able to capture the true cubic DGP fairly well. The regularization process slightly reduced the magnitude of the cubic (the prediction line is a little straighter than it should be), but not by much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does their variance compare to the simple and polynomial linear models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll four LASSO models, fit in different training sets, resulted in very similar prediction lines. Therefore, these LASSO models have low variance, much like the simple linear model. In contrast, the LASSO model variance is clearly lower than the more flexible polynomimal model.\n\n\n\n\nNow we will quantify the performance of these models in training and test sets with the root mean square error performance metric. This is the standard deviation of the error when comparing the predicted values for Y to the actual values (ground truth) for Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What do we expect about RMSE for the three models in train and test?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple linear model is underfit to the TRUE DGP. Therfore it is systematically biased everywhere it is used. It won’t fit well in train or test for this reason. However, it’s not very flexible so it won’t be overfit to the noise in train and therefore should fit comparably in train and test.\nThe polynomial linear model will not be biased at all given that the DGP is polynomial.\nHowever, it is overly flexible (20th order) and so will substantially overfit the training data such that it will show high variance and its performance will be poor in test.\nThe polynomial LASSO will be the sweet spot in bias-variance trade-off. It has a little bias but not much. However, it is not as flexible due to regularization by lambda so it won’t be overfit to its training set. Therefore, it should do well in the test set.\n\n\nTo better understand this:\n\nCompare RMSE across the three model configurations within the training sets (turquoise line)\nCompare how RMSE changes for each model configuration across its training set and the test set\nCompare RMSE across the three model configurations within the test set (red line)?\nSpecifically compare the performance of simple linear model (least flexible) with the polynomial linear model (most flexible)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Would these observations about bias and variance of these three model configurations always be the same regardless of the DGP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. A model configuration needs to be flexible enough and/or well designed to represent the DGP for the data that you are modeling. The two polynomial models in this example were each able to represent a cubic DGP. The simple linear model was not. The polynomial linear model was too flexible for a cubic given that it had 20 polynomials of X. Therefore, it was overfit to its training set and had high variance. However, if the DGP was a different shape, the story would be different. If the DGP was linear the simple linear model would not have been biased and would have performed best. If this DGP was some other form (step function), it may be that none of the models would work well.",

    "text": "2.3 Best Practices and Other Recommendations\n\n2.3.1 Data file formats\nWe generally store data as CSV [comma-separated value] files\n\nEasy to view directly in a text editor\nEasy to share because others can use/import into any data analysis platform\nWorks with version control (e.g. git, svn)\nuse read_csv() and write_csv()\n\nExceptions include:\n\nWe may consider binary (.rds) format for very big files because read/write can be slow for csv files.\n\nBinary file format provides a very modest additional protection for sensitive data (which we also don’t share)\nuse read_rds() and write_rds()\n\nSee chapter 7 - Data Import in Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) for more details and advanced techniques for importing data using read_csv()\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Classing Variables\nWe store and class variables in R based on their data type (level of measurement).\n\nSee Wikipedia definitions for levels of measurement for a bit more precision that we will provide here.\n\nCoarsely, there are four levels:\n\nnominal: qualitative categories, no inherent order (e.g., marital status, sex, car color)\nordinal: qualitative categories (sometimes uses number), inherent order but not equidistant spacing (e.g., Likert scale; education level)\ninterval and ratio (generally treated the same in social sciences): quantitative scores, ordered, equidistant spacing. Ratio has true 0. (e.g., temperature in Celsius vs. Kelvin scales)\n\nWe generally refer to nominal and ordinal variables as categorical and interval/ratio as quantitative or numeric\n\nFor nominal variables\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors when we load them (using read_csv())\nIn some cases, we should pay attention to the order of the levels of the variable. e.g.,\n\nFor a dichotomous outcome variable, the positive/event level of dichotomous factor outcome should be first level of the factor\nThe order of levels may also matter for factor predictors (e.g., step_dummy() uses first level as reference).\n\n\n\nFor ordinal variables:\n\nWe store (in csv files) these variables as character class with descriptive text labels for the levels\n\nEasier to share/document\nReduces errors\n\nWe class these variables in R as factors (just like nominal variables)\n\nIt is easier to do EDA with these variables classes as factors\nWe use standard factors (not ordered)\n\nConfirm that the order of the levels is set up correctly. This is very important for ordinal variables.\nDuring feature engineering stage, we can then either\n\nTreat as a nominal variable and create features using step_dummy()\nTreat as an interval variable using step_ordinalscore()\n\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both nominal and ordinal variable\nOrdinal variables may show non-linear relations b/c they may not be evenly spaced. In these instances, we can use feature engineering approaches that are also used for nominal variables\n\nFor interval and ratio variables:\n\nWe store these variables as numeric\nWe class these variables as numeric (either integer or double - let R decide) during the read and clean stage (They are typically already in this class when read in)\n\nSimilar EDA approaches are used with both interval and ratio variables\nSimilar feature engineering approaches are used with both\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Data Dictionaries\nYou should always make a data dictionary for use with your data files.\n\nIdeally, these are created during the planning phase of your study, prior to the start of data collection\nStill useful if created at the start of data analysis\n\nData dictionaries:\n\nhelp you keep track of your variables and their characteristics (e.g., valid ranges, valid responses)\ncan be used by you to check your data during EDA\ncan be provided to others when you share your data (data are not generally useful to others without a data dictionary)\n\nWe will see a variety of data dictionaries throughout the course. Many are not great as you will learn.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 The Ames Housing Prices Dataset\nWe will use the Ames Housing Prices dataset as a running example this unit (and some future units and application assignments as well)\n\nYou can read more about the original dataset created by Dean DeCock\nThe data set contains data from home sales of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010\nThe original data set includes 2930 observations of sales price and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous)\nThis is the original data dictionary\nThe challenge with this dataset is to build the best possible prediction model for the sale price of the homes.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Packages and Conflicts\nFirst, lets set up our environment with functions from important packages. I strongly recommend reviewing our recommendations for best practices regarding managing function conflicts now. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future.\n\nWe set a conflicts policy that will produce errors if we have unanticipated conflicts.\nWe source a library of functions that we use for common tasks in machine learning.\n\nThis includes a function (tidymodels_conflictRules()) that sets conflict rules to allow us to attach tidymodels functions without conflicts with tidyverse functions.\n\nYou can review that function to see what it does (search for that function name at the link)\n\nThen we use that function\n\n\n\nCode\noptions(conflicts.policy = \"depends.ok\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true\")\ntidymodels_conflictRules()\n\n\n\nNext we load packages for functions that we will use regularly. There are five things to note RE best practices\n\nIf we will use a lot of functions from a package (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels), we attach the full package\nIf we will use only several functions from a package (but plan to use them repeatedly), we use the include.only parameter to just attach those functions.\nAt times, if we plan to use a single function from a package only 1-2x times, we may not even attach that function at all. Instead, we just call it using its namespace (i.e. packagename::functionname)\nIf a package has a function that conflicts with our primary packages and we don’t plan to use that function, we load the package but exclude the function. If we really needed it, we can call it with its namespace as per option 3 above.\nPay attention to conflicts that were allowed to make sure you understand and accept them. (I left the package messages and warnings in the book this time to see them. I will hide them to avoid cluttering book in later units but you should always review them.)\n\n\n\nCode\n1library(janitor, include.only = \"clean_names\")\n2library(cowplot, include.only = \"plot_grid\")\n3library(kableExtra, exclude = \"group_rows\")\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n4library(tidymodels)\n\n\n\n1\n\nAs an alternative, we could have skipped loading the package and instead called the function as janitor::clean_names()\n\n2\n\nSame is true for cowplot package\n\n3\n\nWhen loading kableExtra (which we use often), you will always need to exclude groups_rows() to prevent a conflict with dplyr package in the tidyverse\n\n4\n\nLoading tidymodels will produce conflicts unless you source and call my function tidymodels_conflictRules() (see above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Source and Other Environment Settings\nWe will also source (from github) two other libraries of functions that we use commonly for exploratory data analyses. You should review these function scripts (fun_eda.R; fun_plots.R to see the code for these functions.\n\n\nCode\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true\")\n\n\n\nFinally, we tune our environment a bit more by setting plot themes and print options that we prefer\n\n\nCode\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\noptions(tibble.width = Inf, tibble.print_max = Inf)\n\n\nAnd we set a relative path to our data. This assumes you are using an RStudio project with the path to the data relative to that project file. I’ve provided more detail elsewhere on best practices for managing files and paths.\n\n\nCode\npath_data &lt;- \"data\"\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Read and Glimpse Dataframe\nLets read in the data and glimpse the subset of observations we will work with in Units 2-3 and the first two application assignments.\n\n\nCode\n1data_all &lt;- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"ames_raw_class.csv\"),\n2                     col_types = cols()) |&gt;\n3  glimpse()\n\n\n\n1\n\nFirst we read data using a relative path and the here::here() function. This is a replacement for file.path() that works better for both interactive use and rendering in Quarto when using projects.\n\n2\n\nWe use col_types = cols() to let R guess the correct class for each column. This suppresses messages that aren’t important at this point prior to EDA.\n\n3\n\nIt is good practice to always glimpse() data after you read it.\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 81\n$ PID               &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Cleaning\nEDA could be done using either tidyverse packages and functions or tidymodels (mostly using the recipes package.)\n\nWe prefer to use the richer set of functions available in the tidyverse (and dplyr and purrr packages in particular).\nWe will reserve the use of recipes for feature engineering only when we are building features for models that we will fit in our training sets and evaluation in our validation and test sets.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Data Leakage Issues\nData leakage refers to a mistake made by the developer of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between their training set and held-out validation or test sets\n\nTraining sets are used to fit models with different configurations\nValidation sets are used to select the best model among those with different configurations (not needed if you only have one configuration)\nTest sets are used to evaluate a best model\nWhen splitting data-sets into training, validation and test sets, the goal is to ensure that no data (or information more broadly) are shared between the three sets\n\nNo data or information from test should influence either fitting or selecting models\nTest should only be used once to evaluate a best/final model\nTrain and validation set also must be segregated (although validation sets may be used to evaluate many model configurations)\nInformation necessary for transformations and other feature engineering (e.g., means/sds for centering/scaling, procedures for missing data imputation) must all be based only on training data.\nData leakage is common if you are not careful.\n\n\nIn particular, if we begin to use test data or information about test during model fitting\n\nWe risk overfitting\nThis is essentially the equivalent of p-hacking in traditional analyses\nOur estimate of model performance will be too optimistic, which could have harmful real-world consequences.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Tidy variable names\nUse snake case for variable names\n\nclean_names() from janitor package is useful for this.\nMay need to do further correction of variable names using rename()\nSee more details about tidy names for objects (e.g., variables, dfs, functions) per Tidy Style Guide\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n  clean_names(\"snake\")\n\ndata_all |&gt; names()\n\n\n [1] \"sale_price\"   \"gr_liv_area\"  \"lot_area\"     \"year_built\"   \"overall_qual\"\n [6] \"garage_cars\"  \"garage_qual\"  \"ms_zoning\"    \"lot_config\"   \"bldg_type\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Explore variable classes\nAt this point, we should class all of our variables as either numeric or factor\n\nInterval and ratio variables use numeric classes (dbl or int)\nNominal and ordinal variable use factor class\nUseful for variable selection later (e.g., where(is.numeric), where(is.factor))\n\nSubsequent cleaning steps are clearer if we have this established/confirmed now\n\nWe have a number of nominal or ordinal variables that are classed as character.\nWe have one ordinal variable (overall_qual) that is classed as numeric (because the levels were coded with numbers rather than text)\n\nread_csv() thought was numeric by the levels are coded using numbers\nThe data dictionary indicates that valid values range from 1 - 10.\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_all |&gt; glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;chr&gt; \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA\", \"TA…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;chr&gt; \"RL\", \"RH\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", \"RL…\n$ lot_config   &lt;chr&gt; \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Corner\", \"Inside\", \"Inside\", \"Inside…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;chr&gt; \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"1Fam\", \"TwnhsE\", \"TwnhsE\", \"Twnh…\n\n\n\nWe can the recode overall_qual first and set its levels\nWe can recode all the character variables to factor in one step.

It is not necessary here because overall_qual was numeric and therefore sorts in the expected order. However, if it had been numbers stored as characters, it could sort incorrectly (e.g., 1, 10, 2, 3, …). And obviously if the orders levels were names, the order would have to be specified.\n\n2\n\nWe indicate the levels here.\n\n3\n\nWe use a mutate to re-class all character data to factors. I prefer factor() to forcats::fct() because factor orders the levels alphabetically. Be aware that this could change if your code is used in a region of the world where this sorting is different. I still prefer this to the alternative (in fct()) that orders by the order the levels are found in your data.\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,955\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 215000, 105000, 172000, 189900, 213500, 191500, 236500, 1…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 1656, 896, 1329, 1629, 1338, 1280, 1616, 1804, 1655, 1465…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 31770, 11622, 14267, 13830, 4920, 5005, 5389, 7500, 10000…\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1960, 1961, 1958, 1997, 2001, 1992, 1995, 1999, 1993, 199…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 6, 7, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, TA, T…\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; RL, RH, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, RL, R…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; Corner, Inside, Corner, Inside, Inside, Inside, Inside, I…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, 1Fam, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, TwnhsE, 1Fam, 1Fa…\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Skimming the data\nskim() from the skimr package is a wonderful and customizable function for summary statistics\n\nIt is highly customizable so we can write our own versions for our own needs\nWe use different versions for cleaning and modeling EDA\nFor cleaning EDA, we just remove some stats that we don’t want to see at this time\nWe can get many of the summary stats for cleaning in one call\nWe have a custom skim defined in the fun_eda.R function library that we use regularly.

dictionary, we see that NA for garage_qual should be coded as “no garage”. We will correct this in our data set.\nThis is a pretty poor choice on the part of the researchers who created the dataset because it becomes impossible to distinguish between NA that means no garage vs. true NA for the variable. In fact, if you later do really careful EDA on the full data set with all variables, you will see this problem likely exists in this dataset\nAnyway, let’s correct all the NA for garage_qual to “no_garage” using mutate()\n\n\nCode\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(garage_qual = fct_expand(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"),\n2         garage_qual = replace_na(garage_qual, \"no_garage\"))\n\n\n\n1\n\nFirst add a new level to the factor\n\n2\n\nThen recode NA to that new level\n\n\n\n\nWe will leave the NA for garage_cars as NA because its not clear if that is truly missing or not, based on further EDA not shown here.\n\nWe have one other issue with garage_qual. It is an ordinal variable but we never reviewed the order of its levels. The data dictionary indicates the levels are ordered (best to worst) as:\n\nEx (excellent)\nGd (good)\nTA (typical/average)\nFa (fair)\nPo (poor)\n\nAnd we might assume that no garage is even worse than a poor garage.

We often use anonymous functions when using the functions from the purrr package (e.g., map(), walk())\nWe use walk() from the purrr package to apply our anonymous function to all columns of the data frame at once\nJust copy this code for now\nWe will see simpler uses later that will help you understand iteration with purrr functions\nSee the chapter on iteration in R for Data Science (2e) for more info on map() and walk()\n\n\n\n\n2.4.8 Tidy Responses for Categorical Variables\nFeature engineering with nominal and ordinal variables typically involves\n\nConverting to factors (already did this!)\nOften creating dummy features from these factors\n\nThis feature engineering will use response labels for naming new features\n\nTherefore, it is a good idea to have the responses snake-cased and cleaned up a bit so that these new feature names are clean/clear.\n\nHere is an easy way to convert responses for character variables to snake case using a function (tidy_responses()) we share in fun_eda.R (reproduced here).\n\nThis uses regular expressions (regex), which will will learn about in a later unit on text processing.\nYou could expand this cleaning function if you encounter other issues that need to be cleaned in the factor levels.\n\n\n\nCode\ntidy_responses &lt;- function(column){\n  # replace all non-alphanumeric with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\W\", \"_\"))\n  # replace whitespace with _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\s+\", \"_\"))\n  # replace multiple _ with single _\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_+\", \"_\"))\n  #remove _ at end of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\_$\", \"\"))\n  # remove _ at start of string\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, \\(column) str_replace_all(column, \"\\\\^_\", \"\"))\n  # convert to lowercase\n  column &lt;- fct_relabel(column, tolower)\n  factor(column)\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s use the function\n\n\nCode\ndata_all &lt;- data_all |&gt; \n1  mutate(across(where(is.factor), tidy_responses))\n\n\n\n1\n\nWe use the tidy selection helper function to limit our mutate to only factors.

    "text": "2.6 Working with Recipes\nRecipes are used for feature engineering in tidymodels using the recipes package\n\nUsed for transforming raw predictors into features used in our models\nDescribes all steps to make feature matrix. For example:\n\nTransforming factors into “dummy” features if needed\nLinear and non-linear transformations (e.g., log, box-cox)\nPolynomials and interactions (i.e., x1 * x1 or x1 * x2)\nMissing value imputations\n\nProper use of recipes is an important tool to prevent data leakage between train and either validation or test.\nRecipes use only information from the training set in all feature engineering\nConsider example of standardizing x1 for a feature in train vs. validation and test. Must use mean and sd from TRAIN to standardize x1 in train, validate, and test. VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n\nWe use recipes in a two step process - prep() and bake()\n\n“Prepping” a recipe involves calculating any statistics needed for the transformations that will be applied to engineer features (e.g., mean and standard deviation to normalize a numeric variable).\n\nPrepping is done with the prep() function.\nPrepping is always done only with training data. A “prepped” recipe does not derive any statistics from validation or test sets.\n\n“Baking” is the process of calculating the features\n\nBaking is done with the bake() function.\nWe used our prepped recipe when we bake.\nWhereas we only prep a recipe with training data, we can use a prepped recipe to bake features from any dataset (training, validation, or test).\n\n\n\nWe will work with recipes extensively when model building starting in unit 3\nFor now, we will only use the recipe to indicate roles as a gentle introduction.\nWe will expand on this recipe in unit 3\nRecipe syntax is very similar to generic tidyverse syntax (created by same group)\n\nActually a subset of tidyverse functions\nLess flexible/powerful but focused on our needs and easier to learn\nYou will eventually know both\n\n\nRecipes are used in Modeling scripts (which is a third type of script after cleaning and modeling EDA scripts)\n\nLets reload training again to pretend we are starting a new script\n\n\n\nCode\n data_trn &lt;- read_csv(file.path(path_data, \"ames_clean_class_trn.csv\"), \n                      col_types = cols()) |&gt; \n1  class_ames() |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\n\n\n1\n\nRemember our function for classing!\n\n\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n\n\n\nRecipes can be used to indicate the outcome and predictors that will be used in the model\n\nCan use . to indicate all predictors\n\nCurrently, our preferred method for larger data sets\nWe can exclude some predictors later by changing their role, removing them with a later recipe step (\\(step\\_rm()\\)), or specifying a more precise formula when we fit the model\nSee Roles in Recipes for more info\n\nCan use specific names of predictors along with \\(+\\)\n\nThis is our preferred method when we have a smaller set of predictors (We will show you both approaches)\ne.g., sale_price ~ lot_area + year_built + overall_qual\n\nDo NOT indicate interactions here\n\nAll predictors are combined with +\nInteractions are specified by a later explicit feature engineering step\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrec &lt;- recipe(sale_price ~ ., data = data_trn)\n\nrec\n\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 9\n\n\nCode\nsummary(rec)\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   variable     type      role      source  \n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;list&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 gr_liv_area  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 2 lot_area     &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 3 year_built   &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 4 overall_qual &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 5 garage_cars  &lt;chr [2]&gt; predictor original\n 6 garage_qual  &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 7 ms_zoning    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 8 lot_config   &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n 9 bldg_type    &lt;chr [3]&gt; predictor original\n10 sale_price   &lt;chr [2]&gt; outcome   original\n\n\n\n\n2.6.1 Prepping and Baking a Recipe\nLet’s make a feature matrix from the training set\nThere are two discrete (and important) steps\n\nprep()\nbake()\n\nFirst we prep the recipe using the training data\n\n\nCode\n1rec_prep &lt;- rec |&gt;\n2  prep(training = data_trn)\n\n\n\n1\n\nWe start by prepping our raw/original recipe (rec)\n\n2\n\nWe use the prep() function on on the training data. Recipes are ALWAYS prepped using training data. This makes sure that are recipes will always only use information from the training set when making features for any subsequent dataset. As part of the prepping process, prep() calculates and saves the features for the training data for later use\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, we bake the training data using this prepped recipe to get a feature matrix from it.\nWe set new_data = NULL because don’t need features for new data. Instead, we want features from the training data that were used to prep the recipe\n\n\nCode\nfeat_trn &lt;- rec_prep |&gt; \n  bake(new_data = NULL)\n\n\n\nFinally, we should generally at least glimpse and/or skim (and typically do some more EDA) on our features to make sure our recipe is doing what we expect.\n\nglimpse\n\n\n\nCode\nfeat_trn |&gt; glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 1,465\nColumns: 10\n$ gr_liv_area  &lt;dbl&gt; 896, 882, 864, 836, 918, 1902, 900, 1225, 1728, 858, 1306…\n$ lot_area     &lt;dbl&gt; 11622, 8400, 10500, 2280, 7892, 8930, 9819, 9320, 13260, …\n$ year_built   &lt;dbl&gt; 1961, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1978, 1967, 1959, 1962, 195…\n$ overall_qual &lt;fct&gt; 5, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, …\n$ garage_cars  &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ garage_qual  &lt;fct&gt; ta, ta, no_garage, ta, ta, ta, ta, no_garage, no_garage, …\n$ ms_zoning    &lt;fct&gt; res_high, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_low, res_med, re…\n$ lot_config   &lt;fct&gt; inside, corner, fr2, fr2, inside, inside, inside, inside,…\n$ bldg_type    &lt;fct&gt; one_fam, one_fam, one_fam, town_inside, town_end, duplex,…\n$ sale_price   &lt;dbl&gt; 105000, 126000, 115000, 120000, 99500, 112000, 122000, 12…\n\n\n\n\nskim\n\n\n\nCode\nfeat_trn |&gt; skim_all()\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nfeat_trn\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1465\n\n\nNumber of columns\n10\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nfactor\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\n\noverall_qual\n0\n1\n10\n5: 424, 6: 350, 7: 304, 8: 176\n\n\ngarage_qual\n0\n1\n5\nta: 1312, no_: 81, fa: 57, gd: 13\n\n\nms_zoning\n0\n1\n7\nres: 1157, res: 217, flo: 66, com: 13\n\n\nlot_config\n0\n1\n5\nins: 1095, cor: 248, cul: 81, fr2: 39\n\n\nbldg_type\n0\n1\n5\none: 1216, tow: 108, dup: 63, tow: 46\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nskew\nkurtosis\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area\n0\n1\n1506.84\n511.44\n438\n1128\n1450\n1759\n5642\n1.43\n5.19\n\n\nlot_area\n0\n1\n10144.16\n8177.55\n1476\n7500\n9375\n11362\n164660\n11.20\n182.91\n\n\nyear_built\n0\n1\n1971.35\n29.65\n1880\n1953\n1972\n2000\n2010\n-0.54\n-0.62\n\n\ngarage_cars\n1\n1\n1.78\n0.76\n0\n1\n2\n2\n4\n-0.26\n0.10\n\n\nsale_price\n0\n1\n180696.15\n78836.41\n12789\n129500\n160000\n213500\n745000\n1.64\n4.60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now use our features from training to train models, but that will take place in the next unit!\nWe could also use the prepped recipe to bake validation or test data to evaluate trained models.
