We won't discuss it further here.\n\n![](figs/unit4_lm_vs_logistic.png){height=4in}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLogistic regression provides predicted conditional probabilities for one class (positive class) for any specific set of values for our features (X)\n\n- $Pr(positive\\:class | X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}$\n\n- These conditional probabilities are bounded by [0, 1]\n\n- To maximize accuracy (as per Bayes classifier), \n  - we predict the positive case if $Pr(positive class | X) > .5$ for any specific X\n  - otherwise we predict the negative class   \n  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a simple parametric model, logistic regression is commonly used for explanatory purposes as well as prediction\n\nFor these reasons, it is worthwhile to fully understand how to work with the logistic function to quantify and describe the effects of your features/predictors in terms of \n\n- Probability \n- Odds\n- [Log-odds or logit]\n- Odds ratio\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe logistic function yields the probability of the positive class given X\n\n- However, in some instances (e.g., horse racing, poker), it may make more sense to describe the odds of the positive case occurring rather than probability\n\nOdds are defined with respect to probabilities as follows:\n\n  - $odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|X)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|X)}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, if the UW Badgers have a .5 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, their odds of winning are 1 (to 1)\n\n- $\\frac{0.5} {1 - 0.5}$\n\nIf the UW Badgers have a .75 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, their odds of winning are 3 (:1; '3 to 1')\n\n- $\\frac{0.75} {1 - 0.75}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# Question\nIf the UW Badgers have a .25 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, what are their odds of winning? \n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .uwred}\n.25 / (1 - .25) = 0.33 or 1:3\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe logistic function can be modified to provide odds directly:\n\n**Logistic function**:\n\n- $Pr(positive\\:class | X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}$\n\n\n**Definition of odds**:\n\n- $odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|X)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|X)}$\n\nSubstitute logistic function for $Pr(positive\\:class|X)$ on top and bottom and simplify to get: \n\n- $odds(positive\\:class|X) = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}$\n- Odds are bounded by [0, $\\infty$]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe logistic function can be modified further such that the outcome (log-odds/logit) is a linear function of your features\n\nIf we take the natural log (base e) of both sides of the odds equation, we get:\n\n- $log(odds(positive\\:class|X)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p$\n- Log-odds are unbounded $[-\\infty, \\infty]$\n\nUse of logit transformation:\n\n- provides the connection between the general linear model and generalized linear models (in this case with link = logit, family = binomial).  \n- Notice that the logit/log-odds is a linear combination of the features (just like in the general linear model)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Odds** and **probability** are descriptive but they are not linear functions of X\n\n  - Therefore, parameter estimates from these models aren't very useful to describe the effect of features\n  - This is because unit change in Y per unit change in any specific feature is not the same for all values of the feature\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Log-odds** are a linear function of X\n\n- Therefore, you can say that log-odds of positive class increases by $b_1$ (our estimate of $\\beta_1$) for every one unit increase in $x_1$\n- However, log-odds are NOT very descriptive/intuitive so they are not that useful for explanatory purposes\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **odds ratio** addresses these problems\n\nOdds are defined at a specific set of values across the features in your model.  For example, with one feature:\n \n- $odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)}$\n\nThe odds ratio describes the change in odds for a change of c units in your feature.  With some manipulation: \n\n- $Odds\\:ratio  =  \\frac{odds(x+c)}{odds(x)}$\n- $Odds\\:ratio  =  \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*(x_1 + c)}}{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_1}}$\n- $Odds\\:ratio  = e^{c*\\beta_1}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an example, if we fit a logistic regression model to predict the probability of the Badgers winning a home football game given the attendance (measured in individual spectators at the game), we might find $b_1$ (our estimate of $\\beta_1$) = .000075.\n\nGiven this, the odds ratio associated with every increase in 10,000 spectators:\n\n- $= e^{c * \\b_1}$\n- $= e^{10000 * .000075}$\n- $= 2.1$\n- For every increase of 10,000 spectators, the odds of the Badgers winning doubles\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The Cars Dataset\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\n# set up environment.  Now hidden from view\n\noptions(conflicts.policy = \"depends.ok\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_ml.R?raw=true\")\ntidymodels_conflictRules()\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for general data wrangling\nlibrary(tidymodels) # for modeling\n\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_eda.R?raw=true\")\ndevtools::source_url(\"https://github.com/jjcurtin/lab_support/blob/main/fun_plots.R?raw=true\")\n\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\noptions(tibble.width = Inf)\n\npath_data <- \"./data\"\n``` \n\nNow, let's put this all of this together in the Cars dataset from Carnegie Mellon's [StatLib Dataset Archive](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/)  \n\nOur goal is to build a classifier (machine learning model for a categorical outcome) that classifies cars as either high or low mpg.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Cleaning EDA\n\nLet's start with some cleaning EDA\n\n- Open and \"skim\" it RE variable names, classes & missing data\n- Variable names are already tidy\n- no missing data\n- mins (p0) and maxes(p100) for numeric look good\n- there are two character variables (`mpq` and `name`) that will need to be re-classed\n\n```{r}\ndata_all <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_all.csv\"),\n                    show_col_types = FALSE)\n\ndata_all |> skim_some()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- `mpg` is ordinal, so lets set the levels to indicate the order.\n- After reviewing the [data dictionary](data/auto_data_dictionary.pdf), we see that `origin` is a nominal predictor that is coded numeric (where 1 = American, 2 = European, and 3 = Japanese).  Let's recode as character with meaningful labels and then class as a factor\n- and lets not forget to re-class `name` too\n\n```{r}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  mutate(mpg = factor(mpg, levels = c(\"low\", \"high\")),\n         name = factor(name), \n         origin = factor (origin),\n         origin = fct_recode(as.character(origin), #<1>\n                             \"american\" = \"1\",\n                            \"european\" = \"2\",\n                            \"japanese\" = \"3\")) \n```\n1. `fct_recode()` works on levels stored as characters, so convert 1, 2, 3, to character first.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, we can explore responses for categorical variables\n\n  - Other than `name`, responses for all other variables are tidy\n  - `name` has many different responses\n  - We won't know how to handle this until we get to later units in the class on natural language processing!\n```{r}\ndata_all |> \n  select(where(is.factor)) |>\n  walk(\\(column) print(levels(column)))\n```\n\n- Remove `name`\n```{r}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  select(-name)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, let's make and save our training and validation sets.  If we were doing model building for prediction we would also need a test set but we will focus this unit on just selecting the best model but not rigorously evaluating it.\n\n- Let's use a 75/25 split, stratified on `mpg`\n- Don't forget to set a seed in case you need to re-split again in the future!\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(20110522) \n\nsplits <- data_all |> \n  initial_split(prop = .75, strata = \"mpg\")\n\nsplits |> \n  analysis() |> \n  glimpse() |> \n  write_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_trn.csv\"))\n  \nsplits |> \n  assessment() |> \n  glimpse() |> \n  write_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_val.csv\"))\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# Question\nAny concerns about using this training-validation split?\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .uwred}\nThese sample sizes are starting to get a little small.  Fitted models will have \nhigher variance with only 75% (N = 294) observations and performance in validation \n(with only N = 98 observations) may not be a very precise estimate of true validation \nerror.  We will learn more robust methods in the unit on resampling.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Modeling EDA\n\nLet's do some quick modeling EDA to get a sense of the data.  \n\n- We will keep it quick and dirty.\n- First, we should make a function to class Cars since we may open it frequently\n- Even though its simple, still better this way (e.g., what if we decide to change how to handle classing - will only need to make that change in one place!)\n\n```{r}\nclass_cars <- function(d) { \n  d |> \n    mutate(mpg = factor(mpg, levels = c(\"low\", \"high\")),\n           origin = factor (origin))\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Open train (we don't need validate for modeling EDA)\n- [We are pretending this is a new script....]\n- Class the predictors\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_trn.csv\"),\n                     show_col_types = FALSE) |> \n  class_cars() |> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Bar plot for outcome\n  - Outcome is balanced\n  - Unbalanced outcomes can be more complicated (more on this later)\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> plot_bar(\"mpg\")\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Grouped (by `mpg`) box/violin plots for numeric predictors\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> \n  select(where(is.numeric)) |> \n  names() |> \n  map(\\(name) plot_grouped_box_violin(df = data_trn, x = \"mpg\", y = name)) |> \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Grouped barplot for origin\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> \n  plot_grouped_barplot_percent(x = \"origin\", y = \"mpg\")\n```\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> \n  plot_grouped_barplot_percent(x = \"mpg\", y = \"origin\")\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Correlation plots for numeric\n- Can dummy code categorical predictors to examine correlations (point biserial, phi) including them\n- We will do this manually using tidyverse here.\n- Set american to be reference level (its the first level)\n- `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, and `weight` are all essentially the same construct (big, beefy car!)\n- All are strongly correlated with `mpg`\n\n\n```{r}\n#| out-height: 3in\n\ndata_trn |> \n  mutate(mpg_high = if_else(mpg == \"high\", 1, 0), #<1>\n         origin_japan = if_else(origin == \"japanese\", 1, 0),\n         origin_europe = if_else(origin == \"european\", 1, 0)) |> \n  select(-origin, -mpg) |>  #<2>\n  cor() |> \n  corrplot::corrplot.mixed() \n```\n1. If manually coding a binary outcome variable, best practice is to set the positive class to be 1\n2. Remove `origin` and `mpg` after converting to dummy-coded features\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Logistic Regression - Model Building\nNow that we understand our data a little better, let's build some models\n\nLet's also try to simultaneously pretend that we: \n\n1. Are building and selecting a best prediction model that will be evaluated with some additional held out test data (how bad would it have been to split into three sets??!!)\n2. Have an explanatory question about production `year` - Are we more likely to have efficient cars more recently because of improvements in \"technology\", above and beyond broad car characteristics (e.g., the easy stuff like `weight`, `displacement`, etc.)\n\nTo be clear, prediction and explanation goals are often separate (though prediction is an important foundation explanation)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEither way, we need a validation set\n\n- Open it and class variables\n```{r}\ndata_val <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_val.csv\"),\n                     col_type = cols()) |> \n  class_cars() |> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's predict high `mpg` from car beefiness and `year`\n\nWe likely want to combine the beefy variables into one construct/factor (`beef`)\n\n  - We can use PCA to extract one factor\n  - Input variables should be centered and scaled for PCA.  Easy peasy\n  - PCA will be calculated with `data_trn` during `prep()`.  These statistics from `data_trn` will be used to `bake()`\n```{r}\nrec <- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = data_trn) |> #<1> \n  step_pca(cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, \n           options = list(center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE), \n           num_comp = 1, \n           prefix = \"beef_\") #<2>\n```\n1. Using `.` now in the recipe to leave all variables in the feature  matrix.  We can later select the ones we want use for prediction\n2. We will have one PCA component, it will be called `beef_1`\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, `prep()` the recipe and `bake()` some feature for training and validation sets\n\n```{r}\nrec_prep <- rec |> \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(NULL)\n\nfeat_val <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_val)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Lets skim our training features\n- We can see there are features in there we won't use\n- `mpg`, `year`, and `beef_1` look good\n```{r}\nfeat_trn |> skim_all()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Fit the model configuration in train\n```{r}\nfit_lr_2 <- \n  logistic_reg() |> #<1> \n  set_engine(\"glm\") |> #<2>\n  fit(mpg ~ beef_1 + year, data = feat_trn) #<3>\n```\n1. category of algorithm is logistic regression\n2. Set engine to be generalized linear model.  No need to `set_mode(\"classification\") because logistic regression glm is only used for classification\n3. Notice that we explicitly indicate which features to use because our feature matrix has more than just these two in it because we used `.` in our recipe and our datasets have more columns.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's look at the logistic model and its parameter estimates from train\n\n```{r}\nfit_lr_2 |> tidy()\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\nb0 <- get_estimate(fit_lr_2, \"(Intercept)\")\nb1 <- get_estimate(fit_lr_2, \"beef\")\nb2 <- get_estimate(fit_lr_2, \"year\")\n```\n\n$Pr(high|(beef, year)) = \\frac{e^{b0 + b1*beef + b2*year}}{1 + e^{b0 + b1*beef  + b2*year}}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse `predict()` to get $Pr(high|year)$ (**or predicted class**, more on that later) directly from the model for any data\n\n- First make a dataframe for feature values for prediction\n- We will use this for a plot\n- Get probabilities for a range of years (incrementing by .1 year)\n- Hold beef constant at its mean\n```{r}\np_high <- \n  tibble(year = seq(min(feat_val$year), max(feat_val$year), .1),\n         beef_1 = mean(feat_val$beef_1)) \n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n`predict()` will:\n\n- Give us probabilities for high and low (`type = \"prob\"`).  We will select out the low columns\n- Also provides the 95% conf int around these probabilities (`type = \"conf_int\"`)\n- Ambiguity is removed by their choice to label by the actual outcome labels (Nice!)\n- We will bind these predictions to the dataframe we made above\n```{r}\np_high <- p_high |> \n  bind_cols(predict(fit_lr_2, new_data = p_high, type = \"prob\")) |> \n  bind_cols(predict(fit_lr_2, new_data = p_high, type = \"conf_int\")) |> \n  select(-.pred_low, -.pred_lower_low, -.pred_upper_low) |> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is a quick look at the head\n```{r}\np_high |> head()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan plot this relationship using the predicted probabilities\n\n- plot both prediction line\n- and observed Y (with a little jitter)\n\n```{r}\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = feat_val, aes(x = year, y = as.numeric(mpg) - 1), \n             position = position_jitter(height = 0.05, width = 0.05)) +\n  geom_line(data = p_high, mapping = aes(x = year, y = .pred_high)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = p_high, \n              aes(x = year, ymin = .pred_lower_high, ymax = .pred_upper_high), \n              linetype = 2, alpha = 0.1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Production Year (19XX)\", breaks = seq(70,82,2)) +\n  ylab(\"Pr(High MPG)\")\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan plot odds instead of probabilities using odds equation and coefficients from the model\n\n- $odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)}$\n\n```{r}\np_high <- p_high |> \n  mutate(.odds_high = .pred_high / (1 - .pred_high),\n         .odds_lower_high = .pred_lower_high / (1 - .pred_lower_high),\n         .odds_upper_high = .pred_upper_high / (1 - .pred_upper_high))\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- NOTE: Harder to also plot raw data as scatter plot when plotting odds vs. probabilities.

 $f_k(X)$ is large if there is a high probability that an observation in class k has that set of values for X and small if that probability is low\n  - $f_k(X)$ is difficult to estimate unless we make some simplifying assumptions (i.e., X is multivariate normal and common covariance matrix ($\\sum$) across K classes)\n  - With these assumptions, we can estimate $\\pi_k$, $\\mu_k$, and $\\sigma^2$ from the training set and calculate $Pr(Y = k|X)$ for each k\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith a single feature, the probability of any class k, given X is:\n\n- $Pr(Y = k|X) = \\frac{\\pi_k \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma}}\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu_k)^2)}{\\sum_{l=1}^{K}\\pi_l\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu_l)^2)}$\n\n- LDA is a parametric model, but is it interpretable?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplication of LDA to Cars data set with two predictors\n\nNotice that LDA produces linear decision boundary (see @ISL for formula for discriminant function derived from the probability function on last slide)\n\n```{r}\nrec <- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = data_trn) |> \n  step_pca(cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, \n           options = list(center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE), \n           num_comp = 1, \n           prefix = \"beef_\")\n\nrec_prep <- rec |> \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(NULL)\n\nfeat_val <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_val)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Need to load the `discrm` package\n- Lets look at how the function is called\n```{r}\nlibrary(discrim, exclude = \"smoothness\")\n\ndiscrim_linear() |> \n  set_engine(\"MASS\") |> \n  translate()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFit the LDA in train\n```{r}\nfit_lda_2 <- \n  discrim_linear() |> \n  set_engine(\"MASS\") |> \n  fit(mpg ~ beef_1 + year, data = feat_trn)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccuracy and decision boundary\n\n```{r}\naccuracy_vec(feat_val$mpg, predict(fit_lda_2, feat_val)$.pred_class)\n```\n\n```{r}\np_train <- feat_trn |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_lda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\np_val <- feat_val |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_lda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(p_train, p_val, labels = list(\"Train\", \"Validation\"), hjust = -1.5)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\n\nQDA relaxes one restrictive assumption of LDA\n  \n- Still required multivariate normal X\n- **But it allows each class to have its own $\\sum$**\n- This makes it:\n  - More flexible\n  - Able to model non-linear decision boundaries (see formula for discriminant in @ISL)\n  - But requires substantial increase in parameter estimation (more potential to overfit)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplication of RDA (Regularized Discriminant Analysis) algorithm to Car data set with two features\n\n- The algorithm that is available in tidymodels is actually a regularized discriminant analysis, `rda()` from the `klaR` package\n- There are two hyperparameters, `frac_common_cov` and `frac_identity`, that can each vary between 0 - 1 \n  - When `frac_common_cov = 1` and `frac_identity = 0`, this is an LDA\n  - When `frac_common_cov = 0` and `frac_identity = 0`, this is a QDA\n  - These hyperparameters can be tuned to different values to improve the fit dependent on the true DGP\n  - More on hyperparameter tuning in unit 5\n  - This is a flexible algorithm that likely replaces the need to fit separate LDA and QDA models\n- see https://discrim.tidymodels.org/reference/discrim_regularized.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is a true QDA using `frac_common_cov = 1` and `frac_identity = 0`\n```{r}\ndiscrim_regularized(frac_common_cov = 0, frac_identity = 0) |> \n  set_engine(\"klaR\") |> \n  translate()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Now fit it\n\n```{r}\nfit_qda_2 <- \n  discrim_regularized(frac_common_cov = 0, frac_identity = 0) |> \n  set_engine(\"klaR\") |> \n  fit(mpg ~ beef_1 + year, data = feat_trn)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccuracy and decision boundary\n\n```{r}\naccuracy_vec(feat_val$mpg, \n             predict(fit_qda_2, feat_val)$.pred_class)\n```\n\n```{r}\np_train <- feat_trn |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_qda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\np_val <- feat_val |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_qda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(p_train, p_val, labels = list(\"Train\", \"Validation\"), hjust = -1.5)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Comparisons between these four classifiers\n\n- Both logistic and LDA are linear functions of X and therefore produce linear decision boundaries\n\n- LDA makes additional assumptions about X (multivariate normal and common $\\sum$) beyond logistic regression.  Relative performance is based on the quality of this assumption\n\n- QDA relaxes the LDA assumption about common $\\sum$ (and RDA can relax it partially)\n  - This also allows for nonlinear decision boundaries including 2-way interactions among features\n  - QDA is therefore more flexible, which means possibly less bias but more potential for overfitting\n\n- Both QDA and LDA assume multivariate normal X so *may* not accommodate categorical predictors very well.  Logistic and KNN do accommodate categorical predictors\n\n- KNN is non-parametric and therefore the most flexible\n  - Can also handle interactions and non-linear effects natively (with feature engineering)\n  - Increased overfitting, decreased bias?\n  - Not very interpretable.  But LDA/QDA, although parametric, aren't as interpretable as logistic regression\n\n- Logistic regression fails when classes are perfectly separated (but does that ever happen?) and is less stable when classes are well separated\n\n- LDA, KNN, and QDA naturally accommodate more than two classes  \n  - Logistic requires additional tweak (**Briefly describe: multiple one vs other classes models approach**)\n  \n- Logistic regression requires relatively large sample sizes.  LDA may perform better with smaller sample sizes if assumptions are met. KNN can be computationally very costly with large sample sizes (and large number of X) but could always downsample training set.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n## A quick tour of many classifiers\n\nThe Cars dataset had strong predictors and a mostly linear decision boundary for the two predictors we considered\n\n- This will not be true in many cases\n- Let's consider a more complex two predictor decision boundary in the **circle** dataset from the `mlbench` package (lots of cool datasets for ML)\n- This will hopefully demonstrate that the key is to have a algorithm that can model the DGP\n- There is NO best algorithm\n- The best algorithm depends on \n  - The DGP\n  - The goal (prediction vs. explanation)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis will also demonstrate the power of tidymodels to allow us to fit many different statistical algorithms which all have their own syntax using a common syntax provided by tidymodels.  \n\n- This example has been adapted to tidymodels from a demonstration by

`naivebayes` engines\n- There are many [tutorials](https://uc-r.github.io/naive_bayes) available on this classifier\n\n- Fit it\n```{r}\nfit_bayes_bench <- \n  naive_Bayes() |> \n

involves resampling the data to produce many trees and then aggregating across trees for the final classification\n- We will discuss Random Forest in a later unit\n- Here we fit it with defaults for its hyperparameters\n  \n- Fit it\n```{r}\nfit_rf_bench <- \n  rand_forest() |> \n  set_engine(\"ranger\") |> \n  set_mode(\"classification\") |> \n  fit(classes ~ x_1 + x_2, data =

Introduction to Classification Models\n:::\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n# IAML Unit 4: Introduction to Classification Models\n:::\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Bayes classifier \n- Logistic regression\n  - probability, odds, and logit models\n  - definitions of odds and odds ratios\n- K nearest neighbors for classification\n- Linear discriminant analysis\n- Quadratic discriminant analysis\n- Regularized discriminant analysis\n- Decision boundaries in the two feature space\n- Relative costs and benefits of these different statistical algorithms\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Bayes Classifier\n\nFirst, lets introduce the Bayes classifier, which is the classifier that will have the lowest error rate of all classifiers using the same set of features. \n\nThe figure below displays simulated data for a classification problem for K = 2 classes as a function of `X1` and `X2`\n\n![](figs/unit4_two_class_decision_boundry.png){height=4in}\n\nThe Bayes classifier assigns each observation its most likely class given its conditional probabilities for the values for `X1` and `X2`\n\n- $Pr(Y = k | X = x_0) for\\:k = 1:K$\n- For K = 2, this means assigning to the class with Pr > .50\n- This decision boundary for the two class problem is displayed in the figure\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Bayes classifier provides the minimum error rate for test data\n\n- Error rate for any $x_0$ will be $1 - max (Pr( Y = k | X = x_0))$\n- Overall error rate will be the average of this across all possible X\n- This is the irreducible error for classification problems\n- This is a theoretical model b/c (except for simulated data), we don't know the conditional probabilities based on X\n- Many classification models try to estimate these conditionals\n\nLet's talk now about some of these classification models\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Logistic Regression: A Conceptual Review\n\nLogistic regression (a special case of the **generalized** linear model) estimates the conditional probability for each class given X (a specific set of values for our features)\n\n- In the binary outcome case, we will often refer to the two outcomes as the positive class and the negative class\n- This makes most sense in some applied settings where we are most interested in predicting if one of the two classes is likely, e.g., \n  - Presence of heart disease\n  - Positive for some psychiatric diagnoses\n  - Lapse back to alcohol use in people with alcohol use disorder\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLogistic regression is used frequently for binary and multi-level outcomes because\n\n- The general linear model makes predictions that are not bounded by [0, 1] and do not represent true estimates of conditional probability for each class\n- Logistic regression approaches can be modified to accommodate multi-class outcomes (i.e., more than two levels) even when they are not ordered\n- Nonetheless, the general linear model is still used at times to predict binary outcomes (see [Linear Probability Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probability_model)) so you should be aware of it.  We won't discuss it further here.\n\n![](figs/unit4_lm_vs_logistic.png){height=4in}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLogistic regression provides predicted conditional probabilities for one class (positive class) for any specific set of values for our features (X)\n\n- $Pr(positive\\:class | X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}$\n\n- These conditional probabilities are bounded by [0, 1]\n\n- To maximize accuracy (as per Bayes classifier), \n  - we predict the positive case if $Pr(positive class | X) > .5$ for any specific X\n  - otherwise we predict the negative class   \n  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a simple parametric model, logistic regression is commonly used for explanatory purposes as well as prediction\n\nFor these reasons, it is worthwhile to fully understand how to work with the logistic function to quantify and describe the effects of your features/predictors in terms of \n\n- Probability \n- Odds\n- [Log-odds or logit]\n- Odds ratio\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe logistic function yields the probability of the positive class given X\n\n- However, in some instances (e.g., horse racing, poker), it may make more sense to describe the odds of the positive case occurring rather than probability\n\nOdds are defined with respect to probabilities as follows:\n\n  - $odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|X)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|X)}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, if the UW Badgers have a .5 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, their odds of winning are 1 (to 1)\n\n- $\\frac{0.5} {1 - 0.5}$\n\nIf the UW Badgers have a .75 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, their odds of winning are 3 (:1; '3 to 1')\n\n- $\\frac{0.75} {1 - 0.75}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# Question\nIf the UW Badgers have a .25 probability of winning some upcoming game based on X, what are their odds of winning? \n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .uwred}\n.25 / (1 - .25) = 0.33 or 1:3\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe logistic function can be modified to provide odds directly:\n\n**Logistic function**:\n\n- $Pr(positive\\:class | X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}}$\n\n\n**Definition of odds**:\n\n- $odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|X)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|X)}$\n\nSubstitute logistic function for $Pr(positive\\:class|X)$ on top and bottom and simplify to get: \n\n- $odds(positive\\:class|X) = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p}$\n- Odds are bounded by [0, $\\infty$]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe logistic function can be modified further such that the outcome (log-odds/logit) is a linear function of your features\n\nIf we take the natural log (base e) of both sides of the odds equation, we get:\n\n- $log(odds(positive\\:class|X)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_1 + \\beta_2*X_2 + ... + \\beta_p * X_p$\n- Log-odds are unbounded $[-\\infty, \\infty]$\n\nUse of logit transformation:\n\n- provides the connection between the general linear model and generalized linear models (in this case with link = logit, family = binomial).  \n- Notice that the logit/log-odds is a linear combination of the features (just like in the general linear model)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Odds** and **probability** are descriptive but they are not linear functions of X\n\n  - Therefore, parameter estimates from these models aren't very useful to describe the effect of features\n  - This is because unit change in Y per unit change in any specific feature is not the same for all values of the feature\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Log-odds** are a linear function of X\n\n- Therefore, you can say that log-odds of positive class increases by $b_1$ (our estimate of $\\beta_1$) for every one unit increase in $x_1$\n- However, log-odds are NOT very descriptive/intuitive so they are not that useful for explanatory purposes\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **odds ratio** addresses these problems\n\nOdds are defined at a specific set of values across the features in your model.  For example, with one feature:\n \n- $odds = \\frac{Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)} {1 - Pr(positive\\:class|x_1)}$\n\nThe odds ratio describes the change in odds for a change of c units in your feature.  With some manipulation: \n\n- $Odds\\:ratio  =  \\frac{odds(x+c)}{odds(x)}$\n- $Odds\\:ratio  =  \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*(x_1 + c)}}{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_1}}$\n- $Odds\\:ratio  = e^{c*\\beta_1}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an example, if we fit a logistic regression model to predict the probability of the Badgers winning a home football game given the attendance (measured in individual spectators at the game), we might find $b_1$ (our estimate of $\\beta_1$) = .000075.\n\nGiven this, the odds ratio associated with every increase in 10,000 spectators:\n\n- $= e^{c * \\b_1}$\n- $= e^{10000 * .000075}$\n- $= 2.1$\n- For every increase of 10,000 spectators, the odds of the Badgers winning doubles\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The Cars Dataset\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\n# set up environment.

Let's recode as character with meaningful labels and then class as a factor\n- and lets not forget to re-class `name` too\n\n```{r}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  mutate(mpg = factor(mpg, levels = c(\"low\", \"high\")),\n         name = factor(name), \n         origin = factor (origin),\n         origin = fct_recode(as.character(origin), #<1>\n                             \"american\" = \"1\",\n                            \"european\" = \"2\",\n                            \"japanese\" = \"3\")) \n```\n1. `fct_recode()` works on levels stored as characters, so convert 1, 2, 3, to character first.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, we can explore responses for categorical variables\n\n  - Other than `name`, responses for all other variables are tidy\n  - `name` has many different responses\n  - We won't know how to handle this until we get to later units in the class on natural language processing!\n```{r}\ndata_all |> \n  select(where(is.factor)) |>\n  walk(\\(column) print(levels(column)))\n```\n\n- Remove `name`\n```{r}\ndata_all <- data_all |> \n  select(-name)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, let's make and save our training and validation sets.  If we were doing model building for prediction we would also need a test set but we will focus this unit on just selecting the best model but not rigorously evaluating it.\n\n- Let's use a 75/25 split, stratified on `mpg`\n- Don't forget to set a seed in case you need to re-split again in the future!\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(20110522) \n\nsplits <- data_all |> \n  initial_split(prop = .75, strata = \"mpg\")\n\nsplits |> \n  analysis() |> \n  glimpse() |> \n  write_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_trn.csv\"))\n  \nsplits |> \n  assessment() |> \n  glimpse() |> \n  write_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_val.csv\"))\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# Question\nAny concerns about using this training-validation split?\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .uwred}\nThese sample sizes are starting to get a little small.

We will learn more robust methods in the unit on resampling.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Modeling EDA\n\nLet's do some quick modeling EDA to get a sense of the data.  \n\n- We will keep it quick and dirty.\n- First, we should make a function to class Cars since we may open it frequently\n- Even though its simple, still better this way (e.g., what if we decide to change how to handle classing - will only need to make that change in one place!)\n\n```{r}\nclass_cars <- function(d) { \n  d |> \n    mutate(mpg = factor(mpg, levels = c(\"low\", \"high\")),\n           origin = factor (origin))\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Open train (we don't need validate for modeling EDA)\n- [We are pretending this is a new script....]\n- Class the predictors\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_trn.csv\"),\n                     show_col_types = FALSE) |> \n  class_cars() |> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Bar plot for outcome\n  - Outcome is balanced\n  - Unbalanced outcomes can be more complicated (more on this later)\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> plot_bar(\"mpg\")\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Grouped (by `mpg`) box/violin plots for numeric predictors\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> \n  select(where(is.numeric)) |> \n  names() |> \n  map(\\(name) plot_grouped_box_violin(df = data_trn, x = \"mpg\", y = name)) |> \n  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = _, ncol = 2)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Grouped barplot for origin\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> \n  plot_grouped_barplot_percent(x = \"origin\", y = \"mpg\")\n```\n\n```{r}\ndata_trn |> \n  plot_grouped_barplot_percent(x = \"mpg\", y = \"origin\")\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Correlation plots for numeric\n- Can dummy code categorical predictors to examine correlations (point biserial, phi) including them\n- We will do this manually using tidyverse here.\n- Set american to be reference level (its the first level)\n- `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, and `weight` are all essentially the same construct (big, beefy car!)\n- All are strongly correlated with `mpg`\n\n\n```{r}\n#| out-height: 3in\n\ndata_trn |> \n  mutate(mpg_high = if_else(mpg == \"high\", 1, 0), #<1>\n         origin_japan = if_else(origin == \"japanese\", 1, 0),\n         origin_europe = if_else(origin == \"european\", 1, 0)) |> \n  select(-origin, -mpg) |>  #<2>\n  cor() |> \n  corrplot::corrplot.mixed() \n```\n1. If manually coding a binary outcome variable, best practice is to set the positive class to be 1\n2. Remove `origin` and `mpg` after converting to dummy-coded features\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Logistic Regression - Model Building\nNow that we understand our data a little better, let's build some models\n\nLet's also try to simultaneously pretend that we: \n\n1. Are building and selecting a best prediction model that will be evaluated with some additional held out test data (how bad would it have been to split into three sets??!!)\n2. Have an explanatory question about production `year` - Are we more likely to have efficient cars more recently because of improvements in \"technology\", above and beyond broad car characteristics (e.g., the easy stuff like `weight`, `displacement`, etc.)\n\nTo be clear, prediction and explanation goals are often separate (though prediction is an important foundation explanation)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEither way, we need a validation set\n\n- Open it and class variables\n```{r}\ndata_val <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"auto_val.csv\"),\n                     col_type = cols()) |> \n  class_cars() |> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's predict high `mpg` from car beefiness and `year`\n\nWe likely want to combine the beefy variables into one construct/factor (`beef`)\n\n  - We can use PCA to extract one factor\n  - Input variables should be centered and scaled for PCA.  Easy peasy\n  - PCA will be calculated with `data_trn` during `prep()`.  These statistics from `data_trn` will be used to `bake()`\n```{r}\nrec <- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = data_trn) |> #<1> \n  step_pca(cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, \n           options = list(center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE), \n           num_comp = 1, \n           prefix = \"beef_\") #<2>\n```\n1. Using `.` now in the recipe to leave all variables in the feature  matrix.  We can later select the ones we want use for prediction\n2. We will have one PCA component, it will be called `beef_1`\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, `prep()` the recipe and `bake()` some feature for training and validation sets\n\n```{r}\nrec_prep <- rec |> \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(NULL)\n\nfeat_val <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_val)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Lets skim our training features\n- We can see there are features in there we won't use\n- `mpg`, `year`, and `beef_1` look good\n```{r}\nfeat_trn |> skim_all()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Fit the model configuration in train\n```{r}\nfit_lr_2 <- \n  logistic_reg() |> #<1> \n  set_engine(\"glm\") |> #<2>\n  fit(mpg ~ beef_1 + year, data = feat_trn) #<3>\n```\n1. category of algorithm is logistic regression\n2. Set engine to be generalized linear model.  No need to `set_mode(\"classification\") because logistic regression glm is only used for classification\n3. Notice that we explicitly indicate which features to use because our feature matrix has more than just these two in it because we used `.` in our recipe and our datasets have more columns.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's look at the logistic model and its parameter estimates from train\n\n```{r}\nfit_lr_2 |> tidy()\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\nb0 <- get_estimate(fit_lr_2, \"(Intercept)\")\nb1 <- get_estimate(fit_lr_2, \"beef\")\nb2 <- get_estimate(fit_lr_2, \"year\")\n```\n\n$Pr(high|(beef, year)) = \\frac{e^{b0 + b1*beef + b2*year}}{1 + e^{b0 + b1*beef  + b2*year}}$\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse `predict()` to get $Pr(high|year)$ (**or predicted class**, more on that later) directly from the model for any data\n\n- First make a dataframe for feature values for prediction\n- We will use this for a plot\n- Get probabilities for a range of years (incrementing by .1 year)\n- Hold beef constant at its mean\n```{r}\np_high <- \n  tibble(year = seq(min(feat_val$year), max(feat_val$year), .1),\n         beef_1 = mean(feat_val$beef_1)) \n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n`predict()` will:\n\n- Give us probabilities for high and low (`type = \"prob\"`).

At 1 (K=1) training error is 0\n- Test error shows expected inverted U\n\n  - For high K (left side), error is high because of high variance\n  - As move right (lower K), variance is reduced rapidly with little increase in bias.  Error is reduced.\n  - Eventually, there is diminishing return from reducing variance but bias starts to increase rapidly.  Error increases again.\n\n![](figs/unit4_knn_error.png){height=4in}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## A Return to Cars - Now with KNN\n\nLet's demonstrate KNN using the Cars dataset\n\n- Calculate `beef_1` PCA component\n- Scale both features\n- Make train and validation feature matrices\n\n```{r}\nrec <- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = data_trn) |> \n  step_pca(cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight,\n           options = list(center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE), \n           num_comp = 1, prefix = \"beef_\") |> \n  step_scale(year, beef_1)\n\nrec_prep <- rec |> \n  prep(data = data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(NULL)\n\nfeat_val <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_val)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFit models with varying K.  \n\n- K = 1\n```{r}\nfit_1nn_2 <- \n  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 1) |> \n  set_engine(\"kknn\") |>\n  set_mode(\"classification\") |>  #<1>\n  fit(mpg ~ beef_1 + year, data = feat_trn)\n```\n1.

With KNN, we can visualize decision boundary \n(only in 2 or three dimensions) or the predicted outcome by any feature, controlling for \nother features but these relationships may be complex in shape.  \nOf course, if the relationships are complex, we might not want to hide that.  \nWe will learn more about feature importance for explanation in a later unit.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlot of probability of high_mpg by year, holding `beef_1` constant at its mean based on 10-NN\n\n- Get $Pr(high|year)$ holding beef constant at its mean\n- `predict()` returns probabilities for high and low.\n\n```{r}\np_high <- \n  tibble(year = seq(min(feat_val$year), max(feat_val$year), .1),\n         beef_1 = mean(feat_val$beef_1)) \n\np_high <- p_high |> \n  bind_cols(predict(fit_10nn_2, p_high, type = \"prob\")) |> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Plot it\n- In a later unit, we will learn about feature ablation that we can combine with model comparisons to potentially test predictor effects in non-parametric models\n\n```{r}\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = feat_val, aes(x = year, y = as.numeric(mpg) - 1), \n             position = position_jitter(height = 0.05, width = 0.05)) +\n  geom_line(data = p_high, mapping = aes(x = year, y = .pred_high)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Production Year (19XX)\", \n                     breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 7), \n                     labels = as.character(seq(70, 82, length.out = 7))) +\n  ylab(\"Pr(High MPG)\")\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Linear Discriminant Analysis\nLDA models the distributions of the Xs separately for each class\n\nThen uses Bayes theorem to estimate $Pr(Y = k | X)$ for each k and assigns the  observation to the class with the highest probability\n\n$Pr(Y = k|X) = \\frac{\\pi_k * f_k(X)}{\\sum_{l = 1}^{K} f_l(X)}$\n\nwhere\n\n- $\\pi_k$ is the prior probability that an observation comes from class k (estimated from frequencies of k in training)\n- $f_k(X)$ is the density function of X for an observation from class k\n  -  $f_k(X)$ is large if there is a high probability that an observation in class k has that set of values for X and small if that probability is low\n  - $f_k(X)$ is difficult to estimate unless we make some simplifying assumptions (i.e., X is multivariate normal and common covariance matrix ($\\sum$) across K classes)\n  - With these assumptions, we can estimate $\\pi_k$, $\\mu_k$, and $\\sigma^2$ from the training set and calculate $Pr(Y = k|X)$ for each k\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith a single feature, the probability of any class k, given X is:\n\n- $Pr(Y = k|X) = \\frac{\\pi_k \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma}}\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu_k)^2)}{\\sum_{l=1}^{K}\\pi_l\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu_l)^2)}$\n\n- LDA is a parametric model, but is it interpretable?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplication of LDA to Cars data set with two predictors\n\nNotice that LDA produces linear decision boundary (see @ISL for formula for discriminant function derived from the probability function on last slide)\n\n```{r}\nrec <- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = data_trn) |> \n  step_pca(cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, \n           options = list(center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE), \n           num_comp = 1, \n           prefix = \"beef_\")\n\nrec_prep <- rec |> \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(NULL)\n\nfeat_val <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_val)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Need to load the `discrm` package\n- Lets look at how the function is called\n```{r}\nlibrary(discrim, exclude = \"smoothness\")\n\ndiscrim_linear() |> \n  set_engine(\"MASS\") |> \n  translate()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFit the LDA in train\n```{r}\nfit_lda_2 <- \n  discrim_linear() |> \n  set_engine(\"MASS\") |> \n  fit(mpg ~ beef_1 + year, data = feat_trn)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccuracy and decision boundary\n\n```{r}\naccuracy_vec(feat_val$mpg, predict(fit_lda_2, feat_val)$.pred_class)\n```\n\n```{r}\np_train <- feat_trn |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_lda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\np_val <- feat_val |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_lda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(p_train, p_val, labels = list(\"Train\", \"Validation\"), hjust = -1.5)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\n\nQDA relaxes one restrictive assumption of LDA\n  \n- Still required multivariate normal X\n- **But it allows each class to have its own $\\sum$**\n- This makes it:\n  - More flexible\n  - Able to model non-linear decision boundaries (see formula for discriminant in @ISL)\n  - But requires substantial increase in parameter estimation (more potential to overfit)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplication of RDA (Regularized Discriminant Analysis) algorithm to Car data set with two features\n\n- The algorithm that is available in tidymodels is actually a regularized discriminant analysis, `rda()` from the `klaR` package\n- There are two hyperparameters, `frac_common_cov` and `frac_identity`, that can each vary between 0 - 1 \n  - When `frac_common_cov = 1` and `frac_identity = 0`, this is an LDA\n  - When `frac_common_cov = 0` and `frac_identity = 0`, this is a QDA\n  - These hyperparameters can be tuned to different values to improve the fit dependent on the true DGP\n  - More on hyperparameter tuning in unit 5\n  - This is a flexible algorithm that likely replaces the need to fit separate LDA and QDA models\n- see https://discrim.tidymodels.org/reference/discrim_regularized.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is a true QDA using `frac_common_cov = 1` and `frac_identity = 0`\n```{r}\ndiscrim_regularized(frac_common_cov = 0, frac_identity = 0) |> \n  set_engine(\"klaR\") |> \n  translate()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Now fit it\n\n```{r}\nfit_qda_2 <- \n  discrim_regularized(frac_common_cov = 0, frac_identity = 0) |> \n  set_engine(\"klaR\") |> \n  fit(mpg ~ beef_1 + year, data = feat_trn)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccuracy and decision boundary\n\n```{r}\naccuracy_vec(feat_val$mpg, \n             predict(fit_qda_2, feat_val)$.pred_class)\n```\n\n```{r}\np_train <- feat_trn |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_qda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\np_val <- feat_val |> \n  plot_decision_boundary(fit_qda_2, x_names = c(\"year\", \"beef_1\"), y_name = \"mpg\", n_points = 400)\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(p_train, p_val, labels = list(\"Train\", \"Validation\"), hjust = -1.5)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Comparisons between these four classifiers\n\n- Both logistic and LDA are linear functions of X and therefore produce linear decision boundaries\n\n- LDA makes additional assumptions about X (multivariate normal and common $\\sum$) beyond logistic regression.  Relative performance is based on the quality of this assumption\n\n- QDA relaxes the LDA assumption about common $\\sum$ (and RDA can relax it partially)\n  - This also allows for nonlinear decision boundaries including 2-way interactions among features\n  - QDA is therefore more flexible, which means possibly less bias but more potential for overfitting\n\n- Both QDA and LDA assume multivariate normal X so *may* not accommodate categorical predictors very well.  Logistic and KNN do accommodate categorical predictors\n\n- KNN is non-parametric and therefore the most flexible\n  - Can also handle interactions and non-linear effects natively (with feature engineering)\n  - Increased overfitting, decreased bias?\n  - Not very interpretable.  But LDA/QDA, although parametric, aren't as interpretable as logistic regression\n\n- Logistic regression fails when classes are perfectly separated (but does that ever happen?) and is less stable when classes are well separated\n\n- LDA, KNN, and QDA naturally accommodate more than two classes  \n  - Logistic requires additional tweak (**Briefly describe: multiple one vs other classes models approach**)\n  \n- Logistic regression requires relatively large sample sizes.  LDA may perform better with smaller sample sizes if assumptions are met. KNN can be computationally very costly with large sample sizes (and large number of X) but could always downsample training set.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n## A quick tour of many classifiers\n\nThe Cars dataset had strong predictors and a mostly linear decision boundary for the two predictors we considered\n\n- This will not be true in many cases\n- Let's consider a more complex two predictor decision boundary in the **circle** dataset from the `mlbench` package (lots of cool datasets for ML)\n- This will hopefully demonstrate that the key is to have a algorithm that can model the DGP\n- There is NO best algorithm\n- The best algorithm depends on \n  - The DGP\n  - The goal (prediction vs. explanation)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis will also demonstrate the power of tidymodels to allow us to fit many different statistical algorithms which all have their own syntax using a common syntax provided by tidymodels.  \n\n- This example has been adapted to tidymodels from a demonstration by [Michael Hahsler](https://michael.hahsler.net/SMU/EMIS7332/R/viz_classifier.html)\n- Simulate train and test data\n```{r}\nlibrary(mlbench, include.only =

based on Bayes theorem\n\n- But, we assume that the predictor variables are conditionally independent of one another given the response value\n- This algorithm can be fit with either `klaR` or `naivebayes` engines\n- There are many [tutorials](https://uc-r.github.io/naive_bayes) available on this classifier\n\n- Fit it\n```{r}\nfit_bayes_bench <- \n  naive_Bayes() |> \n

involves resampling the data to produce many trees and then aggregating across trees for the final classification\n- We will discuss Random Forest in a later unit\n- Here we fit it with defaults for its hyperparameters\n  \n- Fit it\n```{r}\nfit_rf_bench <- \n  rand_forest() |> \n  set_engine(\"ranger\") |> \n  set_mode(\"classification\") |> \n  fit(classes ~ x_1 + x_2, data =

network](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/mlp.html) \n\n- We do this below with varying number of hidden units and all other hyperparameters set to defaults\n- We will have a unit on this
