copy the following code chunk into your scripts after you load your other libraries (e.g., tidyverse and tidymodels)\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\ncl <- parallel::makePSOCKcluster(parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE))\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Using Cache\n\nEven with parallel processing, resampling procedures can STILL take a lot of time, particularly on notebook computers that don't have a lot of cores available\n\\\n\\\nIn these instances, you may also want to consider caching the result\n\n- When you cache some set of calculations, you are essentially saving the results of the calculations\n- If you need to run the script again, you simply load the saved calculations again from disk, rather than re-calculating them (its much quicker to just read them from a file)\n\\\n\\\n\nBut...\n\n- You need to redo the calculations if you change anything in your script that could affect them\n- This is called \"invalidating the cache\"\n- You need to be very careful to reuse the cache when you can but also to invalidate it when the calculations have changed\n\n-----\n\nIn other notes, we describe [three options](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_dwvt/cache.html) to cache calculations that are available in R.  \n\n- You should read more about those options if you plan to use one\n- Our preferred solution is to use `xfun::cache_rds()` \n- Read the help for this function (`?xfun::cache_rds`) if you plan to use it \n- Cache is complicated and can lead to errors.   \n- But cache can also save you a lot of time during development!\n\n-----\n\nStart by loading only that function for the `xfun` package.  You can add this line of code after your other libraries (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(xfun, include.only = \"cache_rds\")\n```\n\n-----\n\nTo use the function\n\n- You will pass the code for the calculations you want to cache as the first argument (`expr`) to the function inside a set of curly brackets `{}`\n- You need to list the path (`dir =`) and filename (`file =`) for the rds file that will save the cached calculations.  \n  - The `/` at the end of the path is needed.  \n  - You should use a meaningful (and distinct) filename.\n- Provide `rerun = FALSE` as a third argument.  \n  - You can set this to true temporarily if you need to invalidate the cache to redo the calculations\n  - We like to set it up as an environment variable (see `rerun_setting` below)\n  - Keep it as FALSE during development\n  - Set it to TRUE at the end of our development so that we make sure we didn't make any cache invalidation errors\n- You may also provide a list of globals to `hash =`.  See more details at previous link\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\ncache_rds(\n  expr = {\n },\n dir = \"cache/\",\n file = \"filename\", \n rerun = rerun_setting \n)\n```\n\\\n\\\nWe will demonstrate the use of this function throughout the book.  BUT you do not need to use it if you find it confusing.\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction to Resampling\n\nWe will use resampling for two goals:\n\n- To **select** among model configurations based on relative performance estimates of these configurations in new data\n- To **evaluate** the performance of our best/final model configuration in new data\n\nFor both of these goals we are using new data to **estimate performance** of model configuration(s)\n\n-----\n\nThere are two kinds of problems that can emerge from using a sub-optimal resampling approach\n\n- We can get a **biased estimate** of model performance (i.e., we can systematically under or over-estimate its performance)\n- We can get an **imprecise estimate** of model performance (i.e., high variance in our model performance metric if it was repeatedly calculated in different samples of held-out data)\n\n-----\n\nEssentially, this is the bias and variance problem again, but now not with respect to the model's actual performance but instead with **our estimate of how the model will perform**\n\nThis is a very important distinction to keep in mind or you will be confused as we discuss bias and variance into the future.  We have:\n\n- bias and variance of model performance (i.e., the predictions the model makes)\n- bias and variance of our estimate of how well the model will perform in new data\n- different factors affect each\n\n-----\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\n# set up environment.

We will use the [heart disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  We will focus on the Cleveland data subset, whose variable are defined in this [data dictionary](data/cleveland_variables.pdf)\n\nThese data are less well prepared\n\n- No variable/column names exist\n- NA is coded with `?`\n- Use `rename()` to add tidy variable names\n\n```{r}\ndata_all <- read_csv(here::here(path_data, \"cleveland.csv\"), \n                     col_names = FALSE, # <1> \n                     na = \"?\") |> # <2> \n  rename(age = X1,\n         sex = X2,\n         cp = X3,\n         rest_bp = X4,\n         chol = X5,\n         fbs = X6,\n         rest_ecg = X7,\n         max_hr = X8,\n         exer_ang = X9,\n         exer_st_depress = X10,\n         exer_st_slope = X11,\n         ca = X12,\n         thal = X13,\n         disease = X14)\n```\n1.

We called this held-out set a test set\n  - We would report this performance metric from the held-out test set as our estimate of the performance of our model in new data\n\n-----\n\nIf our goal was to select the best model configuration among many candidate configurations\n\n- We called this held-out set a validation set\n- We would use this performance metric from the held-out validation set to select the best model configuration\n\n-----\n\nWe call this the single validation set approach but that single held-out set can be either a validation or test set depending on our goals\n\\\n\\\nIf you need to BOTH select a best model configuration AND evaluate that best model configuration, you would need both a validation and a test set.\n\n-----\n\nWe have been doing the single validation set approach all along but we will provide one more example now (with a 50/50 split) to transition the code we are using to a more general workflow that will accommodate our more complicated resampling approaches\n\\\n\\\nIn the first half of this unit, we will focus on assessing the performance of a single model configuration\n\n  - Logistic regression algorithm\n  - No hyperparameters\n  - Features based on all available predictors\n  \nWe will call the held-out set a test set and use it to evaluate the expected future performance of this single configuration\n\n-----\n\nPreviously:\n\n- We would fit the model configuration in training and then made predictions for observations in the held-out test set in separate steps\n- We did this in separate steps so you could better understand the process\n- I will show you that first again as a baseline\n  \nThen:\n\n- We will now do these tasks in one step using $validation\\_split()$\n- I will show you this combined approach second\n- This latter approach will be an example for how we code this for our more complicated resampling approaches\n\n-----\n\n- Let's do a 50/50 split, stratified on our outcome, disease\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(19690127)\n\nsplits <- data_all |> \n  initial_split(prop = 0.5, strata = \"disease\")\n\ndata_trn <- analysis(splits)\ndata_trn |>  nrow()\n\ndata_test <- assessment(splits)\ndata_test |> nrow()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Make features for train and test (skim them on your own time!)\n```{r}\nrec_prep <- rec_lr |> \n  prep(data_trn)\n\nfeat_trn <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(NULL)\n\nfeat_test <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_test)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Fit model in train\n\n```{r}\nfit_lr <-\n  logistic_reg() |> \n  set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n  fit(disease ~ ., data = feat_trn)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Evaluate model in test \n\n```{r}\naccuracy_vec(feat_test$disease, predict(fit_lr, feat_test, type = \"class\")$.pred_class)\n```\n\n-----\n\nNow lets do this in a new and more efficient workflow\n\n- We still start by settting up a splits object\n- Note use of `splits_validate()` rather than `initial_split()`\n- We will use a variety of functions at this step depending on how we decide to handle resampling\n```{r}\nset.seed(19690127)\nsplits_validate <- data_all |> \n  validation_split(prop = 0.5, strata = \"disease\")\n```\n\n-----\n\nNow we can fit our model configuration in our training set(s) and calculate performance metric(s) in the held-out sets using `fit_resamples()`\n\n-  You can and should [read more](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/fit_resamples.html) about this function\n- Takes algorithm (broad category, engine, and mode if needed), recipe, and splits as inputs\n- Specify the (set of) metrics we want to use to estimate for our model configuration\n- Don't need to explicitly create feature matrices for held-in and held-out sets.\n  -

This may yield less variance than single 20% or 50% validation set?\n\nbut...\n\n- LOOCV can be computationally expensive (need to fit and evaluate the same model configuration n times).  \n- This is a real problem when you are also working with a high number of model configurations (i.e., number fits = n * number of model configurations).\n\n-----\n\nLOOCV eventually uses all the data in the held-out set across the 'n' held-out sets.  \n\n- Averaging also helps reduce variance in the performance metric.\n- However, averaging reduces variance to a greater degree when the performance measures being averaged are less related/more independent.\n- The n fitted models are very similar in LOOCV b/c they are each fit on almost the same data (each with n-1 observations)\n\\\n\\\n\nK-fold cross validation (next method) improves the variance of the average performance metric by averaging across more independent (less overlapping) training sets\n\n- For this reason, it is superior and (always?) preferred over LOOCV \n- We are not demonstrating LOOCV b/c we strongly prefer other methods (k-fold)\n- Still important to understand it conceptually and its strengths/weaknesses\n- If you wanted to use this resampling approach, simply substitute `loo_cv()` for `vfold_cv()` in the next example\n\n-----\n\n## K-fold Cross Validation\n\nK-fold cross validation\n\n1.  Divide the observations into K equal size independent \"folds\" (each observation appears in only one fold)\n2.  Hold out 1 of these folds (1/Kth of the dataset) to use as a held-out set\n3.  Fit a model in the remaining K-1 folds\n4.  Repeat until each of the folds has been held out once\n5.  Performance estimate is the average performance across the K held-out folds\n\\\n\\\n\nCommon values of K are 5 and 10\n\\\n\\\nNote that K is sometimes referred to as V in some fields/literatures (Don't blame me!)\n\n-----\n\nVisualization of K-fold\n\n![](figs/unit5_kfold.png){height=5in}\n\n-----\n\nLet's demonstrate the code for K-fold Cross-validation\n\n- First, we split into 10 folds (default)\n  - repeats = 1 (default; more on this in a bit)\n  - stratify on `disease`\n\n```{r}\nsplits_kfold <- data_all |> \n  vfold_cv(v = 10, repeats = 1, strata = \"disease\")\n\nsplits_kfold\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Fit model configuration in first 9 folds, evaluate in 10th fold.  Repeat 9 more times for each additional held-out fold\n  - Use `fit_resamples()` as before \n  - Still no need to continue to remake features for held-in and held-out sets.  Just provide `splits` and `rec`\n  - Set performance metrics with `metric_set()`\n\n```{r}\nfits_lr_kfold <- \n  logistic_reg() |> \n  set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n  fit_resamples(preprocessor = rec_lr, \n                resamples = splits_kfold, \n                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Then, we review performance estimates in held out folds using `collect_metrics()`\n\n  - Can see performance in all folds using `summarize = FALSE`\n  - The performance estimates are not all the same.  This is what we mean when we talk about the variance in our performance estimates.  You couldn't see it before with only one held-out set but now that we have 10, it becomes more concrete.  Ideally this variance is as low as possible. \n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold <- collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold, summarize = FALSE)\n\nmetrics_kfold |> print_kbl()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Could plot this as a histogram to visualize this variance (i.e., the sampling distribution of performance estimates)\n- Would be better if we had more folds (see repeats in a bit)\n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold |> plot_hist(\".estimate\")\n``` \n\n-----\n\n- Can see the average performance over folds along with its standard error using `summarize = TRUE`\n- This average will have lower variance (which is estimated by the standard error.  Still not zero!)\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold, summarize = TRUE)\n```\n\n-----\n\n  As a last step, we still fit the final model as before using the full dataset\n\n  - We already have the feature matrix for the full dataset (`feat_all`) from earlier\n  - Otherwise, remake it\n```{r}\nfit_lr <-\n  logistic_reg() |> \n  set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n  fit(disease ~ ., data = feat_all)\n```\n\n-----\n\n```{r}\nfit_lr |> tidy()\n```\n\\\n\\\nIf we need to predict disease in the future, this is the fitted model we would use (with these parameter estimates)\n\\\n\\\nOur estimate of its future accuracy is `r collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold, summarize = TRUE)$mean` with a standard error of `r collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold, summarize = TRUE)$std_err`\n\n-----\n\nComparisons between K-fold vs. LOOCV and Single Validation set\n\\\n\\\nFor Bias:\n\n- K-fold typically has less bias than the single validation set method\n  - E.g. 10-fold fits models with 9/10th of the data vs. 50% or 80%, etc\n\n- K Fold has somewhat more bias than LOOCV because LOOCV uses n - 1 observations for fitting models\n\n-----\n\nFor Variance:\n\n- K-fold has less variance than LOOCV\n  - Like LOOCV, it uses all observations in test at some point\n  - The averaged models are more independent b/c models are fitted on less overlapping training sets\n  \n- K-fold has less variance than single validation set b/c it uses all data as test at some point (vs. a subset of held-out test data)\n\n- K-fold is less computationally expensive than LOOCV (though more expensive than single validation set)\n\n- K-fold is generally preferred over both of these other approaches\n\n-----\n\nK-fold is less computationally intensive BUT still can be costly.  Particularly when you are getting performance estimates for multiple model configurations (more on that when we learn how to tune hyperparameters)\n\\\n\\\nSo you may want to start caching the `fits_` object so you don't have to recalculate it.  \n\n-----\n\nHere is a demonstration\n\n- First we set up an environment variable that we can flip between true/false to invalidate all our cached calculations\n- Put this near the top of your code with other environment settings so its easy to find\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\nrerun_setting <- TRUE \n```\n\n-----\n\n- Now use the `cache_rds()` function\n- Put the resampling code inside of `{}`\n- Cached file will be saved in `cached/` folder with filename `fits_lr_kfold_HASH`\n- If you change any code in the function, it will invalidate the cache and re-run the code\n- However, it will not invalidate the cache if you change objects or data that affect this function but are outside it, e.g., \n  - Fix errors in data\n  - Update `rec_lr`\n  - Update `splits_kfold`\n  - Be VERY careful!\n- You can manually invalidate just the cache for just this code chunk by setting `rerun = TRUE` temporarily or  you can change `rerun_setting <- TRUE` at the top of your script to do fresh calculations for all of your cached code chunks\n- You can set `rerun_settings <- TRUE` when you are done with your development to make sure everything is accurate (review output carefully for any changes!)\n\n```{r fits_lr_kfold}\nfits_lr_kfold <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    logistic_reg() |> \n    set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n    fit_resamples(preprocessor = rec_lr, \n                  resamples = splits_kfold, \n                  metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n  }, \n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_lr_kfold\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Repeated K-fold Cross Validation\n\nYou can repeat the K-fold procedure multiple times with new splits for a different mix of K folds each time\n\\\n\\\nTwo benefits:\n\n- More stable performance estimate (because averaged over more folds: repeats * K)\n- Many more estimates of performance to characterize (SE; plot) of your performance estimate\n\\\n\\\n\nBut it is computationally expensive (depending on number of repeats)\n\n-----\n\nAn example of Repeated K-fold Cross-validation\n\n- Splits with repeats = 10 (will do 10 different splits of 10-fold)\n```{r}\nset.seed(19690127)\nsplits_kfold10x <- data_all |> \n  vfold_cv(v = 10, repeats = 10, strata = \"disease\")\n\nsplits_kfold10x\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Everything else is the same!\n```{r fits_lr_kfold10x}\nfits_lr_kfold10x <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    logistic_reg() |> \n      set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n      fit_resamples(preprocessor = rec_lr, \n                    resamples = splits_kfold10x, \n                    metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n  }, \n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_lr_kfold10x\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Individual estimates across 100 held-out folds\n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold10x <- collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold10x, summarize = FALSE)\n\nmetrics_kfold10x |> print_kbl()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Histogram of those 100 individual estimates\n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold10x |> plot_hist(\".estimate\", bins = 10)\n```\n\n-----\n\nAverage performance estimated (and its SE) across the 100 held-out folds\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold10x, summarize = TRUE)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- You should also refit a final model in the full data at the end as before\n- We wont demonstrate that here\n\n-----\n\nComparisons between repeated K-fold and K-fold\n\\\n\\\nRepeated K-fold: \n\n- Has same bias as K-fold (still fitting models with K-1 folds)\n- Has all the benefits of single K-fold\n- Has even more stable estimate of performance (mean over more folds/repeats)\n- Provides more info about distribution for the performance estimate\n- **But** is more computationally expensive\n\\\n\\\n\nRepeated K-fold is preferred over K-fold to the degree possible based on computational limitations (parallel, N, p, statistical algorithm, # of model configurations)\n\n-----\n\n## Grouped K-fold\n\nWe have to be particularly careful with resampling methods when we have repeated observations for the same participant (or unit of analysis more generally)\n\n- We can often predict an individual's own data better using some of their own data.  \n- If our model will not ever encounter that individual again, this will optimistically bias our estimate of our models performance with new/future observations.  \n- We can remove that bias by making sure that all observations from an individual are grouped together so that they always either held-in or held-out but never split across both.  \n- Easy to do a grouped K-fold by making splits using [`group_vfold_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/group_vfold_cv.html) and then proceeding as before with all other analyses/code\n  - set the `group` argument to the name of the variable that codes for subid or unit of analysis that is repeated.\n\n-----\n\n## Bootstrap Resampling\n\nA bootstrap sample is a random sample taken with replacement (i.e., same observations can be sampled multiple times within one bootstrap sample)\n\\\n\\\nIf you bootstrap a new sample of size n from a dataset with sample size n, approximately 63.2% of the original observations end up in the bootstrap sample\n\\\n\\\nThe remaining 36.8% of the observations are often called the \"out of bag\" (OOB) samples\n\n-----\n\nBootstrap Resampling\n\n- Creates B bootstrap samples of size n = n from the original dataset\n- For any specific bootstrap (b)\n  - Model(s) are fit to the bootstrap sample\n  - Model performance is evaluated in the associated out of bag (held-out) samples\n- This is repeated B times such that you have B assessments of model performance\n\n-----\n\nAn example of Bootstrap resampling\n\n- Again, all that changes is how you form the splits/resamples\n- You will use [$bootstraps()$](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/bootstraps.html) to form the splits\n- Here are 100 bootstraps stratified on `disease`\n```{r}\nset.seed(19690127)\nsplits_boot <- data_all |> \n  bootstraps(times = 100, strata = \"disease\") \n\nsplits_boot\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Everything else is the same!\n```{r fits_lr_boot}\nfits_lr_boot <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    logistic_reg() |> \n      set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n      fit_resamples(preprocessor = rec_lr, \n                    resamples = splits_boot, \n                    metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n\n  },\n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_lr_boot\", \n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- 100 individual performance estimates from the 100 OOB sets\n```{r}\nmetrics_boot <- collect_metrics(fits_lr_boot, summarize = FALSE)\n\nmetrics_boot |> print_kbl()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Histogram of those 100 performance estimates\n```{r}\nmetrics_boot |> plot_hist(\".estimate\", bins = 10)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Average performance over those 100 estimates\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_lr_boot, summarize = TRUE)\n```\n\n- You should also refit a final model in the full data at the end as before to get final single fitted model for later use\n\n-----\n\nRelevant comparisons, strengths/weaknesses for bootstrap for resampling\n\n-  The bootstrap resampling performance estimate will have higher bias than K-fold using typical K values (bias equivalent to about K = 2)\n- Although training sets have full n, they only include about 63% unique observations.  These models under perform training sets with 80 - 90% unique observations\n- With smaller training set sizes, this bias is considered too high by some (Kuhn)\n \n-----\n\n- The bootstrap resampling performance estimate will have less variance than K-fold\n- Compare SE of accuracy for 100 resamples using k-fold with repeats: `r collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold10x, summarize = TRUE)$std_err` vs. bootstrap: `r collect_metrics(fits_lr_boot, summarize = TRUE)$std_err`\n- With 1000 bootstraps (and test sets with ~ 37% of n) can get a very precise estimate of held-out error\n\n-----\n\n- Can also represent the variance of our held-out error (like repeated K-fold)\n\n- Used primarily for selecting among model configurations when you don't care about bias and just want a precise selection metric\n- Useful in explanation scenarios where you just need the \"best\" model\n- \"Inner loop\" of nested cross validation (more on this later)\n\n-----\n\n## Using Resampling to Select Best Model Configurations \n\nIn all of the previous examples, we have used various resampling methods only to evaluate the performance of a single model configuration in new data.  In these instances, we were treating the held-out sets as test sets.\n\\\n\\\nResampling is also used to get held out performance estimates to select best model configurations.  \n\\\n\\\n**Best** means the model configuration that performs the best in new data and therefore is closest to the true DGP for the data\n\n-----\n\nFor example, we might want to select among model configurations in an explanatory scenario to have a principled approach to determine the model configuration that best matches the true DGP (and would be best to test your hypotheses).  e.g., \n\n- Selecting covariates to include\n- Deciding on X transformations\n- Outlier identification approach\n- Statistical algorithm\n\n-----\n\nWe can simply get performance estimates for each configuration using one of the previously described resampling methods\n\n- We would call the held-out data (the single set, the folds, the OOB samples) a validation set\n- We select the model configuration with the best mean (or median?) across our resampled validation sets on the relevant performance metric.\n\n-----\n\nOne additional common scenario where you will do model selection across many model configurations is when \"tuning\" (i.e., selecting) the best values for hyperparameters for a statistical algorithm (e.g., k in KNN).  \n\n-----\n\n`tidymodels` makes this easy and it follows a very similar workflow as earlier with a few changes\n\n- We will need to indicate which hyperparameters we plan to tune in the statistical algorithm\n- We need (or can) select values to consider for that hyperparameter (or we can let the `tune` package functions decide in some cases)\n- We will now use [`tune_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html) rather `fit_resamples()` to fit and evaluate the models configurations that differ with respect to their hyperparameters\n- This IS computationally costly.  Now fitting and estimating performance for multiple configurations across multipe held-in/held-out sets\n\n-----\n\nLets use bootstrap resampling to select the best K for KNN applied to our heart disease dataset\n\\\n\\\nWe can use the same splits are established as before (`splits_boot`)\n\\\n\\\nWe need a slightly different recipe for KNN vs. logistic regression\n\n- We have to scale (lets range correct) the features \n- No need to do this to the dummy features.  They are already range corrected\n\n```{r}\nrec_knn <- recipe(disease ~ ., data = data_all) |> \n  step_impute_median(all_numeric_predictors()) |> \n  step_impute_mode(all_nominal_predictors()) |>   \n  step_range(all_numeric()) |> \n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe fitting process is what is different\n\n- We set up a tibble with values of the hyperparameters to consider\n- We indicate which hyperparameters need to be tuned\n  \n```{r}\nhyper_grid <- expand.grid(neighbors = seq(1, 150, by = 3))\nhyper_grid\n```\n  \n-----  \n\n- When model configurations differ by features or statistical algorithms, we have to use `fit_resamples()` multiple times to estimate performance of those different configurations\n- Held out performance estimates for model configurations that differ by hyperparameter values are obtained in one step using `tune_grid()` \n- We need to set `grid =` \n```{r fits_knn_boot}\nfits_knn_boot <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) |> \n      set_engine(\"kknn\") |> \n      set_mode(\"classification\") |>\n      tune_grid(preprocessor = rec_knn, \n                resamples = splits_boot, \n                grid = hyper_grid,\n                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n\n  },\n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_knn_boot\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\nReviewing performance of model configurations is similar to before but now with multiple configurations\n\n- We can see the average performance over folds along with its standard error using `summarize = TRUE`\n- We *could* see the performance of each configuration in EACH fold too, but there are lots of them (use `summarize = FALSE`)\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_knn_boot, summarize = TRUE)\n```\n\n-----\n\n-  We can plot average performance by the values of the hyperparameter\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_knn_boot, summarize = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = neighbors, y = mean)) +\n    geom_line()\n```\n\nK (neighbors) is affecting the bias-variance trade-off.  As K increases, model bias increases but model variance decreases.  In most instances, model variance decreases faster than model bias increases.  Therefore performance should increase and then peak at a good point along the bias-variance trade-off.  Beyond this optimal value, performance should decrease again.  You want to select a hyperparameter value that is associated with peak (or near peak) performance.\n\n-----\n\nThe simplest way to select among model configurations (e.g., hyperparameters) is to choose the model configuration with the best performance\n\n```{r}\nshow_best(fits_knn_boot, n = 10)\n\nselect_best(fits_knn_boot)\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe next most common is to choose the simplest (least flexible) model that has performance within one SE of the best performing configuration.\n\n- Use `select_by_one_std_err()`\n- Sort performance results from least to most flexible (e.g., `desc(neighbors)`)\n```{r}\nselect_by_one_std_err(fits_knn_boot, \n                      desc(neighbors))\n```\n\n-----\n\n- We should also refit a final model with the \"best\" hyperparameter using the full data as before\n\n\n```{r}\nrec_prep <- rec_knn |>   \n  prep(data_all)\n\nfeat_all <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_all)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- We can use the `select_*()` from above to use this best hyperparameter in our specification of the algorithm\n\n- Note that we now fit using all the data and switch to `fit()` rather than `tune_grid()`\n\n```{r}\nfit_knn_best <-\n  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = select_best(fits_knn_boot)$neighbors) |> \n  set_engine(\"kknn\") |> \n  set_mode(\"classification\") |>\n  fit(disease ~ ., data = feat_all)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- However, we can't use the previous bootstrap resampling to evaluate this final/best model because we already used it to select this the best configuration\n- We need new, held-out data to evaluate it (a new test set!)\n\n-----\n\n## Resampling for Both Model Selection and Evaluation\n\nResampling methods can be used to get model performance estimates to **select** the best model configuration and/or **evaluate** that best model\n\n- So far we have done EITHER selection OR evaluation but not both together\n\n- The concepts to both select the best configuration and evaluation it are similar but it requires different (slightly more complicated) resampling than what we have done so far\n\n-----\n\n- If you use your held-out resamples to select the best model among a number of model configurations then the same held-out resamples cannot also be used to evaluate the performance of that same best model\n\n- If it is, the performance metric will have **optimization bias**.  To the degree that there is any noise (i.e., variance) in the measurement of performance, selecting the best model configuration will capitalize on this noise.\n\n- You need to use one set of held out resamples (validation sets) to select the best model.  Then you need a DIFFERENT set of held out resamples (test sets) to evaluate that best model.   \n\n-----\n\nThere are two strategies for this: \n\n- Strategy 1: \n    - First, hold out a test set for final/best model evaluation (using `initial_split()`).  \n    - Then use one of the above resampling methods (single validation set approach, k-fold, or bootstrap) to select the best model configuration.  \n    - Bootstrap is likely best option b/c it is typically more precise (though biased)\n  \n- Strategy 2: Nested resampling.  More on this in a moment\n\n-----\n\nOther Observations about Common Practices: \n\n- Simple resampling methods with the full sample (and no held-out test set) to both select AND evaluate are still common\n- Failure by some (even Kuhn) to appreciate the degree of optimization bias\n- Particular problem in Psychology because of small n (high variance in our performance metric)?\n- Can be fine if you just want to find the best model configuration but don't need to evaluate its performance rigorously (i.e., you don't really care that much about validity of your performance estimate of your final  model and are fine with it being a bit optimistic)\n\n-----\n\n### Bootstrap with Test Set\n\n- First we divide our data into training and test using `inital_split()`\n\n- Next, we use bootstrap resampling with the training set to split training into many held-in and held-out sets.  We use these held-out (OOB) sets as validation sets to select the best model configuration based on mean/median performance across those sets.  \n  \n- After we select the best model configuration using bootstrap resampling of the training set\n  - We refit that model configuration in the FULL training set\n  - And we use that model to predict into the test set to evaluate it\n\n- Of course, in the end, if you plan to use the model, you will refit this final model configuration to the FULL dataset but the performance estimate for that model will come from test set on th previous step (there are no more data to estimate new performance)\n\n-----\n  \n- Use `initial_split()` for first train/test split\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(123456)\nsplits_test <- data_all |> \n  initial_split(prop = 2/3, strata = \"disease\")\n\ndata_trn <- splits_test |> \n  analysis()\n\ndata_test <- splits_test |> \n  assessment()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Use training set for model selection via resampling (in this case bootstrap)\n- No need for another seed\n\n```{r}\nsplits_boot_trn <- data_trn |> \n  bootstraps(times = 100, strata = \"disease\") \n```\n\n- Use the same grid of hyperparameters we set up earlier (`hyper_grid`)\n\n-----\n\n- Fit model configurations that vary by K in all 100 bootstrap samples\n- Make predictions and calculate accuracy for these fitted models in 100 OOB (validation) sets\n\n```{r fits_knn_boot_trn}\nfits_knn_boot_trn <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) |> \n      set_engine(\"kknn\") |> \n      set_mode(\"classification\") |>\n      tune_grid(preprocessor = rec_knn, \n                resamples = splits_boot_trn, \n                grid = hyper_grid, \n                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n  },\n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_knn_boot_trn\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Select the best model configuration (best k)\n  - K = 97 is the best model configuration determined by bootstrap resampling \n\n  - BUT this is NOT the correct estimate of its performance in new data\n\n  - We compared 50 model configurations (values of k).

In this case, 1/3 of the total sample size.\n  - This will yield a high variance/imprecise estimate of model performance\n \n- It also yields a biased estimate of model performance\n  - The model we evaluated in test was fit to only the training data which was only 2/3 of total sample size\n  - Yet our true final model is trained with the full dataset\n  - We are likely underestimating its true performance\n\n-----\n\nNested resampling offers an improvement with respect to these two issues\n\\\n\\\nNested resampling involves two loops\n\n  - The inner loop is used for model selection\n  - The outer loop is used for model evaluation\n\\\n\\\n\nNested resampling is VERY CONFUSING at first (like the first year you use it!)\n\\\n\\\nNested resampling isn't fully supported by tidymodels as of yet.  You  have to do some coding to iterate over the outer loop\n\\\n\\\nApplication of nested resampling is outside the scope of this course but you should understand it conceptually.

Bootstrap yields low variance performance\nestimates (but they are biased).  We want low variance to select best model\nconfiguration.  K-fold is a good method for less biased performance estimates.  \nWe want less bias in our final evaluation of our best model.

I did repeated k-fold cross validation with a KNN model where k = 5. The effective sample size was n ~ 800 during model selection. Then I refit the model with the full training data where n ~ 1000 and submitted my predictions for the test set. After some testing with one of the TAs, I figured that my submitted model with a larger N performed worse than the model evaluated with resamples, if I used the same K determined via resampling (number of nearest neighbors). My hunch was that the optimal K (number of nearest neighbors) was different in a model trained with n ~ 800 than a model trained with n ~ 1000. Is this a possible explanation? If so, would LOOCV better serve the purpose of selecting a K for the final KNN model (so that the training set for selecting K is very much the same as the training set used for the final model)?\n\n- On average, what do you expect about the performance estimate of your final model configuration in test vs. the performance estimates used to select the best model configuration?\n- What if you used bootstrap to select best configuration?\n- ...but, what about choosing k from train and then using that k in a model fit to train and val?\n  -

copy the following code chunk into your scripts after you load your other libraries (e.g., tidyverse and tidymodels)\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\ncl <- parallel::makePSOCKcluster(parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE))\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Using Cache\n\nEven with parallel processing, resampling procedures can STILL take a lot of time, particularly on notebook computers that don't have a lot of cores available\n\\\n\\\nIn these instances, you may also want to consider caching the result\n\n- When you cache some set of calculations, you are essentially saving the results of the calculations\n- If you need to run the script again, you simply load the saved calculations again from disk, rather than re-calculating them (its much quicker to just read them from a file)\n\\\n\\\n\nBut...\n\n- You need to redo the calculations if you change anything in your script that could affect them\n- This is called \"invalidating the cache\"\n- You need to be very careful to reuse the cache when you can but also to invalidate it when the calculations have changed\n\n-----\n\nIn other notes, we describe [three options](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_dwvt/cache.html) to cache calculations that are available in R.  \n\n- You should read more about those options if you plan to use one\n- Our preferred solution is to use `xfun::cache_rds()` \n- Read the help for this function (`?xfun::cache_rds`) if you plan to use it \n- Cache is complicated and can lead to errors.   \n- But cache can also save you a lot of time during development!\n\n-----\n\nStart by loading only that function for the `xfun` package.  You can add this line of code after your other libraries (e.g., tidyverse, tidymodels)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(xfun, include.only = \"cache_rds\")\n```\n\n-----\n\nTo use the function\n\n- You will pass the code for the calculations you want to cache as the first argument (`expr`) to the function inside a set of curly brackets `{}`\n- You need to list the path (`dir =`) and filename (`file =`) for the rds file that will save the cached calculations.  \n  - The `/` at the end of the path is needed.  \n  - You should use a meaningful (and distinct) filename.\n- Provide `rerun = FALSE` as a third argument.  \n  - You can set this to true temporarily if you need to invalidate the cache to redo the calculations\n  - We like to set it up as an environment variable (see `rerun_setting` below)\n  - Keep it as FALSE during development\n  - Set it to TRUE at the end of our development so that we make sure we didn't make any cache invalidation errors\n- You may also provide a list of globals to `hash =`.  See more details at previous link\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\ncache_rds(\n  expr = {\n },\n dir = \"cache/\",\n file = \"filename\", \n rerun = rerun_setting \n)\n```\n\\\n\\\nWe will demonstrate the use of this function throughout the book.  BUT you do not need to use it if you find it confusing.\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction to Resampling\n\nWe will use resampling for two goals:\n\n- To **select** among model configurations based on relative performance estimates of these configurations in new data\n- To **evaluate** the performance of our best/final model configuration in new data\n\nFor both of these goals we are using new data to **estimate performance** of model configuration(s)\n\n-----\n\nThere are two kinds of problems that can emerge from using a sub-optimal resampling approach\n\n- We can get a **biased estimate** of model performance (i.e., we can systematically under or over-estimate its performance)\n- We can get an **imprecise estimate** of model performance (i.e., high variance in our model performance metric if it was repeatedly calculated in different samples of held-out data)\n\n-----\n\nEssentially, this is the bias and variance problem again, but now not with respect to the model's actual performance but instead with **our estimate of how the model will perform**\n\nThis is a very important distinction to keep in mind or you will be confused as we discuss bias and variance into the future.  We have:\n\n- bias and variance of model performance (i.e., the predictions the model makes)\n- bias and variance of our estimate of how well the model will perform in new data\n- different factors affect each\n\n-----\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\n# set up environment.

This may yield less variance than single 20% or 50% validation set?\n\nbut...\n\n- LOOCV can be computationally expensive (need to fit and evaluate the same model configuration n times).  \n- This is a real problem when you are also working with a high number of model configurations (i.e., number fits = n * number of model configurations).\n\n-----\n\nLOOCV eventually uses all the data in the held-out set across the 'n' held-out sets.  \n\n- Averaging also helps reduce variance in the performance metric.\n- However, averaging reduces variance to a greater degree when the performance measures being averaged are less related/more independent.\n- The n fitted models are very similar in LOOCV b/c they are each fit on almost the same data (each with n-1 observations)\n\\\n\\\n\nK-fold cross validation (next method) improves the variance of the average performance metric by averaging across more independent (less overlapping) training sets\n\n- For this reason, it is superior and (always?) preferred over LOOCV \n- We are not demonstrating LOOCV b/c we strongly prefer other methods (k-fold)\n- Still important to understand it conceptually and its strengths/weaknesses\n- If you wanted to use this resampling approach, simply substitute `loo_cv()` for `vfold_cv()` in the next example\n\n-----\n\n## K-fold Cross Validation\n\nK-fold cross validation\n\n1.

Performance estimate is the average performance across the K held-out folds\n\\\n\\\n\nCommon values of K are 5 and 10\n\\\n\\\nNote that K is sometimes referred to as V in some fields/literatures (Don't blame me!)\n\n-----\n\nVisualization of K-fold\n\n![](figs/unit5_kfold.png){height=5in}\n\n-----\n\nLet's demonstrate the code for K-fold Cross-validation\n\n- First, we split into 10 folds (default)\n  - repeats = 1 (default; more on this in a bit)\n  - stratify on `disease`\n\n```{r}\nsplits_kfold <- data_all |> \n  vfold_cv(v = 10, repeats = 1, strata = \"disease\")\n\nsplits_kfold\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Fit model configuration in first 9 folds, evaluate in 10th fold.  Repeat 9 more times for each additional held-out fold\n  - Use `fit_resamples()` as before \n  - Still no need to continue to remake features for held-in and held-out sets.  Just provide `splits` and `rec`\n  - Set performance metrics with `metric_set()`\n\n```{r}\nfits_lr_kfold <- \n  logistic_reg() |> \n  set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n  fit_resamples(preprocessor = rec_lr, \n                resamples = splits_kfold, \n                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Then, we review performance estimates in held out folds using `collect_metrics()`\n\n  - Can see performance in all folds using `summarize = FALSE`\n  - The performance estimates are not all the same.  This is what we mean when we talk about the variance in our performance estimates.  You couldn't see it before with only one held-out set but now that we have 10, it becomes more concrete.  Ideally this variance is as low as possible. \n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold <- collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold, summarize = FALSE)\n\nmetrics_kfold |> print_kbl()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Could plot this as a histogram to visualize this variance (i.e., the sampling distribution of performance estimates)\n- Would be better if we had more folds (see repeats in a bit)\n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold |> plot_hist(\".estimate\")\n``` \n\n-----\n\n- Can see the average performance over folds along with its standard error using `summarize = TRUE`\n- This average will have lower variance (which is estimated by the standard error.

Fix errors in data\n  - Update `rec_lr`\n  - Update `splits_kfold`\n  - Be VERY careful!\n- You can manually invalidate just the cache for just this code chunk by setting `rerun = TRUE` temporarily or  you can change `rerun_setting <- TRUE` at the top of your script to do fresh calculations for all of your cached code chunks\n- You can set `rerun_settings <- TRUE` when you are done with your development to make sure everything is accurate (review output carefully for any changes!)\n\n```{r fits_lr_kfold}\nfits_lr_kfold <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    logistic_reg() |> \n    set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n    fit_resamples(preprocessor = rec_lr, \n                  resamples = splits_kfold, \n                  metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n  }, \n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_lr_kfold\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Repeated K-fold Cross Validation\n\nYou can repeat the K-fold procedure multiple times with new splits for a different mix of K folds each time\n\\\n\\\nTwo benefits:\n\n- More stable performance estimate (because averaged over more folds: repeats * K)\n- Many more estimates of performance to characterize (SE; plot) of your performance estimate\n\\\n\\\n\nBut it is computationally expensive (depending on number of repeats)\n\n-----\n\nAn example of Repeated K-fold Cross-validation\n\n- Splits with repeats = 10 (will do 10 different splits of 10-fold)\n```{r}\nset.seed(19690127)\nsplits_kfold10x <- data_all |> \n  vfold_cv(v = 10, repeats = 10, strata = \"disease\")\n\nsplits_kfold10x\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Everything else is the same!\n```{r fits_lr_kfold10x}\nfits_lr_kfold10x <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    logistic_reg() |> \n      set_engine(\"glm\") |> \n      fit_resamples(preprocessor = rec_lr, \n                    resamples = splits_kfold10x, \n                    metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n  }, \n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_lr_kfold10x\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Individual estimates across 100 held-out folds\n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold10x <- collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold10x, summarize = FALSE)\n\nmetrics_kfold10x |> print_kbl()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Histogram of those 100 individual estimates\n```{r}\nmetrics_kfold10x |> plot_hist(\".estimate\", bins = 10)\n```\n\n-----\n\nAverage performance estimated (and its SE) across the 100 held-out folds\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold10x, summarize = TRUE)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- You should also refit a final model in the full data at the end as before\n- We wont demonstrate that here\n\n-----\n\nComparisons between repeated K-fold and K-fold\n\\\n\\\nRepeated K-fold: \n\n- Has same bias as K-fold (still fitting models with K-1 folds)\n- Has all the benefits of single K-fold\n- Has even more stable estimate of performance (mean over more folds/repeats)\n- Provides more info about distribution for the performance estimate\n- **But** is more computationally expensive\n\\\n\\\n\nRepeated K-fold is preferred over K-fold to the degree possible based on computational limitations (parallel, N, p, statistical algorithm, # of model configurations)\n\n-----\n\n## Grouped K-fold\n\nWe have to be particularly careful with resampling methods when we have repeated observations for the same participant (or unit of analysis more generally)\n\n- We can often predict an individual's own data better using some of their own data.  \n- If our model will not ever encounter that individual again, this will optimistically bias our estimate of our models performance with new/future observations.  \n- We can remove that bias by making sure that all observations from an individual are grouped together so that they always either held-in or held-out but never split across both.  \n- Easy to do a grouped K-fold by making splits using [`group_vfold_cv()`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/group_vfold_cv.html) and then proceeding as before with all other analyses/code\n  -

These models under perform training sets with 80 - 90% unique observations\n- With smaller training set sizes, this bias is considered too high by some (Kuhn)\n \n-----\n\n- The bootstrap resampling performance estimate will have less variance than K-fold\n- Compare SE of accuracy for 100 resamples using k-fold with repeats: `r collect_metrics(fits_lr_kfold10x, summarize = TRUE)$std_err` vs. bootstrap: `r collect_metrics(fits_lr_boot, summarize = TRUE)$std_err`\n- With 1000 bootstraps (and test sets with ~ 37% of n) can get a very precise estimate of held-out error\n\n-----\n\n- Can also represent the variance of our held-out error (like repeated K-fold)\n\n- Used primarily for selecting among model configurations when you don't care about bias and just want a precise selection metric\n- Useful in explanation scenarios where you just need the \"best\" model\n- \"Inner loop\" of nested cross validation (more on this later)\n\n-----\n\n## Using Resampling to Select Best Model Configurations \n\nIn all of the previous examples, we have used various resampling methods only to evaluate the performance of a single model configuration in new data.  In these instances, we were treating the held-out sets as test sets.\n\\\n\\\nResampling is also used to get held out performance estimates to select best model configurations.  \n\\\n\\\n**Best** means the model configuration that performs the best in new data and therefore is closest to the true DGP for the data\n\n-----\n\nFor example, we might want to select among model configurations in an explanatory scenario to have a principled approach to determine the model configuration that best matches the true DGP (and would be best to test your hypotheses).  e.g., \n\n- Selecting covariates to include\n- Deciding on X transformations\n- Outlier identification approach\n- Statistical algorithm\n\n-----\n\nWe can simply get performance estimates for each configuration using one of the previously described resampling methods\n\n- We would call the held-out data (the single set, the folds, the OOB samples) a validation set\n- We select the model configuration with the best mean (or median?) across our resampled validation sets on the relevant performance metric.\n\n-----\n\nOne additional common scenario where you will do model selection across many model configurations is when \"tuning\" (i.e., selecting) the best values for hyperparameters for a statistical algorithm (e.g., k in KNN).  \n\n-----\n\n`tidymodels` makes this easy and it follows a very similar workflow as earlier with a few changes\n\n- We will need to indicate which hyperparameters we plan to tune in the statistical algorithm\n- We need (or can) select values to consider for that hyperparameter (or we can let the `tune` package functions decide in some cases)\n- We will now use [`tune_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html) rather `fit_resamples()` to fit and evaluate the models configurations that differ with respect to their hyperparameters\n- This IS computationally costly.  Now fitting and estimating performance for multiple configurations across multipe held-in/held-out sets\n\n-----\n\nLets use bootstrap resampling to select the best K for KNN applied to our heart disease dataset\n\\\n\\\nWe can use the same splits are established as before (`splits_boot`)\n\\\n\\\nWe need a slightly different recipe for KNN vs. logistic regression\n\n- We have to scale (lets range correct) the features \n- No need to do this to the dummy features.  They are already range corrected\n\n```{r}\nrec_knn <- recipe(disease ~ ., data = data_all) |> \n  step_impute_median(all_numeric_predictors()) |> \n  step_impute_mode(all_nominal_predictors()) |>   \n  step_range(all_numeric()) |> \n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe fitting process is what is different\n\n- We set up a tibble with values of the hyperparameters to consider\n- We indicate which hyperparameters need to be tuned\n  \n```{r}\nhyper_grid <- expand.grid(neighbors = seq(1, 150, by = 3))\nhyper_grid\n```\n  \n-----  \n\n- When model configurations differ by features or statistical algorithms, we have to use `fit_resamples()` multiple times to estimate performance of those different configurations\n- Held out performance estimates for model configurations that differ by hyperparameter values are obtained in one step using `tune_grid()` \n- We need to set `grid =` \n```{r fits_knn_boot}\nfits_knn_boot <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) |> \n      set_engine(\"kknn\") |> \n      set_mode(\"classification\") |>\n      tune_grid(preprocessor = rec_knn, \n                resamples = splits_boot, \n                grid = hyper_grid,\n                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n\n  },\n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_knn_boot\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\nReviewing performance of model configurations is similar to before but now with multiple configurations\n\n- We can see the average performance over folds along with its standard error using `summarize = TRUE`\n- We *could* see the performance of each configuration in EACH fold too, but there are lots of them (use `summarize = FALSE`)\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_knn_boot, summarize = TRUE)\n```\n\n-----\n\n-  We can plot average performance by the values of the hyperparameter\n```{r}\ncollect_metrics(fits_knn_boot, summarize = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = neighbors, y = mean)) +\n    geom_line()\n```\n\nK (neighbors) is affecting the bias-variance trade-off.  As K increases, model bias increases but model variance decreases.  In most instances, model variance decreases faster than model bias increases.  Therefore performance should increase and then peak at a good point along the bias-variance trade-off.  Beyond this optimal value, performance should decrease again.  You want to select a hyperparameter value that is associated with peak (or near peak) performance.\n\n-----\n\nThe simplest way to select among model configurations (e.g., hyperparameters) is to choose the model configuration with the best performance\n\n```{r}\nshow_best(fits_knn_boot, n = 10)\n\nselect_best(fits_knn_boot)\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe next most common is to choose the simplest (least flexible) model that has performance within one SE of the best performing configuration.\n\n- Use `select_by_one_std_err()`\n- Sort performance results from least to most flexible (e.g., `desc(neighbors)`)\n```{r}\nselect_by_one_std_err(fits_knn_boot, \n                      desc(neighbors))\n```\n\n-----\n\n- We should also refit a final model with the \"best\" hyperparameter using the full data as before\n\n\n```{r}\nrec_prep <- rec_knn |>   \n  prep(data_all)\n\nfeat_all <- rec_prep |> \n  bake(data_all)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- We can use the `select_*()` from above to use this best hyperparameter in our specification of the algorithm\n\n- Note that we now fit using all the data and switch to `fit()` rather than `tune_grid()`\n\n```{r}\nfit_knn_best <-\n  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = select_best(fits_knn_boot)$neighbors) |> \n  set_engine(\"kknn\") |> \n  set_mode(\"classification\") |>\n  fit(disease ~ ., data = feat_all)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- However, we can't use the previous bootstrap resampling to evaluate this final/best model because we already used it to select this the best configuration\n- We need new, held-out data to evaluate it (a new test set!)\n\n-----\n\n## Resampling for Both Model Selection and Evaluation\n\nResampling methods can be used to get model performance estimates to **select** the best model configuration and/or **evaluate** that best model\n\n- So far we have done EITHER selection OR evaluation but not both together\n\n- The concepts to both select the best configuration and evaluation it are similar but it requires different (slightly more complicated) resampling than what we have done so far\n\n-----\n\n- If you use your held-out resamples to select the best model among a number of model configurations then the same held-out resamples cannot also be used to evaluate the performance of that same best model\n\n- If it is, the performance metric will have **optimization bias**.  To the degree that there is any noise (i.e., variance) in the measurement of performance, selecting the best model configuration will capitalize on this noise.\n\n- You need to use one set of held out resamples (validation sets) to select the best model.  Then you need a DIFFERENT set of held out resamples (test sets) to evaluate that best model.   \n\n-----\n\nThere are two strategies for this: \n\n- Strategy 1: \n    - First, hold out a test set for final/best model evaluation (using `initial_split()`).  \n    - Then use one of the above resampling methods (single validation set approach, k-fold, or bootstrap) to select the best model configuration.  \n    - Bootstrap is likely best option b/c it is typically more precise (though biased)\n  \n- Strategy 2: Nested resampling.  More on this in a moment\n\n-----\n\nOther Observations about Common Practices: \n\n- Simple resampling methods with the full sample (and no held-out test set) to both select AND evaluate are still common\n- Failure by some (even Kuhn) to appreciate the degree of optimization bias\n- Particular problem in Psychology because of small n (high variance in our performance metric)?\n- Can be fine if you just want to find the best model configuration but don't need to evaluate its performance rigorously (i.e., you don't really care that much about validity of your performance estimate of your final  model and are fine with it being a bit optimistic)\n\n-----\n\n### Bootstrap with Test Set\n\n- First we divide our data into training and test using `inital_split()`\n\n- Next, we use bootstrap resampling with the training set to split training into many held-in and held-out sets.  We use these held-out (OOB) sets as validation sets to select the best model configuration based on mean/median performance across those sets.  \n  \n- After we select the best model configuration using bootstrap resampling of the training set\n  - We refit that model configuration in the FULL training set\n  - And we use that model to predict into the test set to evaluate it\n\n- Of course, in the end, if you plan to use the model, you will refit this final model configuration to the FULL dataset but the performance estimate for that model will come from test set on th previous step (there are no more data to estimate new performance)\n\n-----\n  \n- Use `initial_split()` for first train/test split\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(123456)\nsplits_test <- data_all |> \n  initial_split(prop = 2/3, strata = \"disease\")\n\ndata_trn <- splits_test |> \n  analysis()\n\ndata_test <- splits_test |> \n  assessment()\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Use training set for model selection via resampling (in this case bootstrap)\n- No need for another seed\n\n```{r}\nsplits_boot_trn <- data_trn |> \n  bootstraps(times = 100, strata = \"disease\") \n```\n\n- Use the same grid of hyperparameters we set up earlier (`hyper_grid`)\n\n-----\n\n- Fit model configurations that vary by K in all 100 bootstrap samples\n- Make predictions and calculate accuracy for these fitted models in 100 OOB (validation) sets\n\n```{r fits_knn_boot_trn}\nfits_knn_boot_trn <- cache_rds(\n  expr = {\n    nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) |> \n      set_engine(\"kknn\") |> \n      set_mode(\"classification\") |>\n      tune_grid(preprocessor = rec_knn, \n                resamples = splits_boot_trn, \n                grid = hyper_grid, \n                metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n  },\n  dir = \"cache/005/\",\n  file = \"fits_knn_boot_trn\",\n  rerun = rerun_setting)\n```\n\n-----\n\n- Select the best model configuration (best k)\n  - K = 97 is the best model configuration determined by bootstrap resampling \n\n  - BUT this is NOT the correct estimate of its performance in new data\n\n  - We compared 50 model configurations (values of k).

In this case, 1/3 of the total sample size.\n  - This will yield a high variance/imprecise estimate of model performance\n \n- It also yields a biased estimate of model performance\n  - The model we evaluated in test was fit to only the training data which was only 2/3 of total sample size\n  - Yet our true final model is trained with the full dataset\n  - We are likely underestimating its true performance\n\n-----\n\nNested resampling offers an improvement with respect to these two issues\n\\\n\\\nNested resampling involves two loops\n\n  - The inner loop is used for model selection\n  - The outer loop is used for model evaluation\n\\\n\\\n\nNested resampling is VERY CONFUSING at first (like the first year you use it!)\n\\\n\\\nNested resampling isn't fully supported by tidymodels as of yet.

BUT VERY COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE\n```\n:::\n\n-----\n\n## Data Exploration with Advanced Resampling Methods \nFinal words on resampling:\n\n- Iterative methods (K-fold, bootstrap) are superior to single validation set approach wrt bias-variance trade-off in performance measurement\n\n- K-Fold resampling should be used if you looking for a performance estimate of a single model configuration\n\n- Bootstrap resampling should be used if you are looking only to choose among model configurations but don't need an independent assessment of that final model\n\n- Bootstrap resampling + Test set or Nested Resampling should be used when you plan to both select among model configurations AND evaluate the best model\n\n\nIn scenarios where you will not have one test set but will eventually use all the data as test ast some point (i.e., k-fold for evaluation of a single model configuration or Nested CV)\n\n- Think carefully about how you do EDA\n- Resampling reduces overfitting in the model selection process \n- Can use eyeball sample (10-20% of full data) with little impact on final performance measure \n\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Announcements\n\n- Starting Unit 6 (Regularization/Penalized models) at end of class today; All set!\n- Unit 7 is Mid-term Exam unit\n  - No readings, lecture or quiz\n  - Application assignment as exam (due at normal application assignment day/time; Weds, March 6th at 8pm)\n  - Conceptual exam during discussion meeting (Thursday March 7th at 11 am) \n- Room assignments; 121 next week but staying in 338;  Thanks for the feedback!\n- EDA with new datasets (and the last application assignment)\n\nFeedback\n\n- concepts in color?, code visually distinct!!\n- tables for contrasts vs. text. - will try for this year but can't promise (still working on terms)\n- reading papers using the methods - have one selected will consider more once we know enough!\n- other ways to submit questions linked to **lecture slides**??\n- direct links to slides format?\n- captions?

I did repeated k-fold cross validation with a KNN model where k = 5. The effective sample size was n ~ 800 during model selection. Then I refit the model with the full training data where n ~ 1000 and submitted my predictions for the test set. After some testing with one of the TAs, I figured that my submitted model with a larger N performed worse than the model evaluated with resamples, if I used the same K determined via resampling (number of nearest neighbors). My hunch was that the optimal K (number of nearest neighbors) was different in a model trained with n ~ 800 than a model trained with n ~ 1000. Is this a possible explanation? If so, would LOOCV better serve the purpose of selecting a K for the final KNN model (so that the training set for selecting K is very much the same as the training set used for the final model)?\n\n- On average, what do you expect about the performance estimate of your final model configuration in test vs. the performance estimates used to select the best model configuration?\n- What if you used bootstrap to select best configuration?\n- ...but, what about choosing k from train and then using that k in a model fit to train and val?\n  - best k, \n  - best k within +- 1 SE (lower limit or higher limit)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":"html_document","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"css":["book.css"],"output-file":"005_resampling.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
