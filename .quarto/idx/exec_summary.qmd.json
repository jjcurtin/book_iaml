Scaling by the standard deviation of each feature is often used.  Can also scale by the range (but more sensitive to outliers).\n- includes one primary hyper-parameter to tune (k) that can be used to impact the bias-variance trade-off.  Larger values of k will generally reduce variance but increase bias.  Smaller values of k will generally reduce bias but increase variance.\n\n- does not formally \"fit\" a model per se;  instead, it makes predictions for a new observation by identifying the k most similar observations (based on distance; see below) in the training data.  The algorithm then uses the outcomes for those k similar training observations to make its outcome prediction for the new observation.  If the outcome is numeric (a regression problem), the algorithm predicts the mean outcome across the k training observations.  If the outcome is categorical (a classification problem), the algorithm predicts the most frequent outcome category across the k training observations.  Category probabilities can also be obtained based on the proportion of each category across the k training observations.  \n- is **not natively interpretable**;  Interpretation is done using visualization and feature importance approaches. \n\n- **natively accommodates non-linear relationships** between features and outcome without additional feature engineering.  \n- **natively accommodates interactions** among features without additional feature engineering.   \n\n- **variance** is  relatively high due to its flexibility.  Requires relatively large N to reduce variance.  Requirements for N are greater still if there are many features because the training data needs to \"fill\" the full multidimensional feature space with sufficient observations that are similar/near to any observation for prediction. Correlations among features further increases variance in part due to inflating the number of features needed for prediction (given redundancy among features). Higer values of k can be used to reduce model variance (but again, need sufficient N to have k observations near any observation for prediction).\n- **bias** is generally low because the algorighm can natively accommodate any DGP.  Correlations among features can increase bias because it distor ts the calculation of distance between observations.  Higher values of k will also increase bias.\n\nCalculating distance in KNN:\n\n- KNN uses distance calculations to identify the k most similar observations in the training data for making predictions for new observation(s)\n- The most common distance metric is Euclidean distance, which is the straight-line distance between two points in multidimensional space.  This is calculated using the L2 norm (the sum of the squared differences across features between the two observations).  It is historically the most common distanc metric because it an intuitive way to measure distance (straight line between points) and works well with well behaved numeric features that are scaled similarly, normally distributed, and uncorrelated.  \n- Other distance metrics include Manhattan distance (L1 norm; sum of absolute differences across features), Minkowski distance (a generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances), and Gower (not implemented in tidymodels)\n- The choice of distance metric can impact model performance and can be tuned by training knn model configurations with different distance metrics and comparing their performance in validation sets. \n- Although Euclidean is the most common metric for KNN, there are several situations where Manhattan is expected to perform better: \n    - Manhattan is more robust to outliers than Euclidean because it does not square the differences across features.  \n    - Manhattan may work better than Euclidean when the features are correlated (Euclidean assumes orthongonal features - think about hypotenuse in right angle triangle).\n    - Manhattan may work better than Euclidean when the there are many features or the data are sparse.\n    - Manhattan may work better than Euclidean if the features are not normally distributed (e.g., skewed distributions) because the squaring of differences in Euclidean can give more weight to outliers and extreme values.\n- Gower distance (not natively available in tidymodels) is a distance metric that may better accommodate both numeric and nominal features.\n\n\nScaling numeric features is very important for valid calculations of distance\n\n- It is generally recommended to NOT scale binary features but leave them as 0/1.\n- There are two common classes of approaches for scaling numeric features: scaling by the feature SD or scaling by the feature range\n- Scaling by the feature SD is less sensitive to outliers.  But scaling by the range could be done more robustly by using the range between the 1st and 99th percentiles rather than min vs. max (not directly implemented in tidymodels but can be approximated external estimates in training data).  Alternatively, scaling by the range can be done robustly if you first remove outliers from the training data (e.g., using `step_filter()`)\n- Range scaling may work better when using Manhattan distance and SD scaling may work better with Euclidean distance.\n- Range (or robust range) scaling numeric features may work better than SD scaling when mixing numeric and binary (e.g., from dummy coding).  If instead, you SD scale the numeric features, they will make bigger contributions to prediction than the binary features.\n\n\nTypical feature engineering steps for KNN include:\n\n- imputing missing values\n- collapsing infrequent levels of nominal predictors to reduce the number of features  (if using dummy coding or similar approaches)\n- dummy coding or other methods to accommodate nominal predictors  \n- scaling features to allow for distance calculations\n- principal components analysis or similar dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the number of features and/or multicollinearity among features.  However, use of PCA can make the model even less interpretable.\n- If using Euclidean distance, power transformations of features that arent normally distributed may improve the calculation of distances.   Alternatively, use Manhattan distance.\n\n \n### Logistic Regression\n\n### LDA and QDA\n\n## LASSO, Ridge, and GLMNet\n\n### Random Forest\n\n### Single hidden layer neural network\n\n## Cross Validation\n\nWe typically need\n\n  - training set(s) to fit (often many) model configurations\n  - validation set(s) to select the best model configuration\n  - test set(s) to evaluate the performance of that best model configuration without optimization bias\n\nWe have several cross validation strategies to consider:\n\n- **Single validation set with a test set** approach, which provides one training, one validation and one test set.  This approach is often used when you have VERY BIG data because issues of bias and variance of the performance estimate are minimized with big data and this approach has the lowest computational costs.\n\n- **Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) with a test set**, which provides N training and validation sets with each validation set containing 1 participant.  This approach is useful to understand key concepts about cross-validation but is almost never the best choice for actual use.\n\n- **K-fold with a test set**, which provides K training and validation sets and one test set.  We can also do R repeats of K-fold to increase the number of training and validation sets to R x K.  This is often the best strategy with moderate sized data sets (though nested resampling may be better still).\n\n- **Bootstrap cross-validation with a test set**, which provides B (number of bootstraps) training and validation sets and one test set.  The bootstrap resample is size N and is used as the training set. It will contain approximately 63% unique observations with the remaining observations as duplicates.  The Out of Bag (OOB) sample is used as the validation set and it will contain approximately 37% of the N, all unique and none included in the bootstrap resample.  Bootstrap cross validation error (from validation sets) is often more pessimistically biased than K-fold validation error. However, in some circumstances, it is lower variance than K-fold error.  \n\n-  **Nested cross validation** provides multiple test sets which can reduce the variance of the test error metric.  It requires that you specify a CV method for both the inner and outer loops.   K-fold is a good choice for the outer loop.  The inner loop can also be k-fold or bootstrap CV.  The number of training, validation, and tests sets that are provided are dependent on choices for CV on the inner and outer loops.  \n\nOther considerations\n\n- It is common to create the resampling splits by first stratifying on the outcome variable.  This will make sure the distribution of the outcome variable is similar across splits.\n\n- If there are repeated observations for the same individual or other nested structures to the data, you should used grouped CV (often as part of k-fold) to make sure that all observations from a participate are always held-in or held-out together.\n\n\nThe choice of CV method has implications for both the bias and the variance of the performance metric.   There are several guuding principles/intuitions that can help you understand the impact of DV decisions on the bias/variance of your performance metric.\n\n- Smaller held-out sets (validation or test) will yield higher variance performance estimates\n- The variance of the performance estimate can be lowered by averaging across multiple held-out sets (e.g., as with K-fold and bootstrap CV).\n- However, averaging is only effective if the performance estimates that are being averaged are not highly related/correlated with each other.  For example, this is why averaging is not very effective in LOOCV.\n- Biased performance estimates results from having training set sizes that are smaller than the full sample size.  The larger this discrepancy, the bigger the bias.\n- There is often a tension between the size of training sets vs. held-out (validation or test) sets.  As you put more data into training, you will have smaller validation or test sets.   This yields a bias-variance trade-off.\n\n\n## Performance metics\n\n## Feature Importance\n\n## L1 and L2 Norms\n\n### Overview and uses\n\n### L1\n\n### L2\n\n### Comparisons\n\n## Dimensionality reduction methods\n\n### Principal components analysis\n\n### Autoencoders\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## Algorithms\n\n### General Linear Model\n\n- is a parametric model that can be used for regression problems\n- requires numeric features.\n- does not have any hyper-parameters to tune\n- does not natively include regularization (but see LASSO, Ridge, and GLMNet) or other characteristics (e.g., hyper-parameters) that can be used to impact the bias-variance trade-off.  \n\n- parameters are estimated to minimize the sum of squared errors in training data\n- is a **natively more interpretable** algorithm;  More so, if the number of features is low and the features are not highly correlated.
