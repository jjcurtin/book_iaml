PCA can help.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## GLM assumptions\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n# What are GLM assumptions and what happens if violated\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .uwred}\n- Measurement error\n\n- Independent\n\n- Normal\n  - Consequence: lm parameter estimates still unbiased (for linear DGP) but more \"efficient\" solutions exist\n  - Bad for prediction b/c higher variance than other solutions\n  - May suggest omission of variables\n\n- Constant\n  - Consequence: Inefficient and inaccurate standard errors.\n  - Statistical tests wrong\n  - Poor prediction for some (where larger variance of residuals) $\\hat{y}$\n  - higher variance overall than other solutions - bad again for prediction\n\n- Linear\n  - Residuals do not have mean of 0 for every $\\hat{y}$\n  - Consequence: biased parameter estimates.  Linear is bad DGP\n  - Also bad test of questions RE the predictor (underestimate? misinform)\n  \n  \nUse of `plot_truth()` [predicted vs. observed] to assess latter three assumptions\n:::\n\n## Transformations of numeric predictors\n\nNormalizing transformations - Yeo Johnson\n\n- when needed for lm?\n- when needed for knn?\n\n- Transformation of outcome?  \n  - metric\n  - back to raw predictions\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Bias and Variance of estimates\n\nBias and variance- general\n\n- property of any estimate\n- for now, we will focus on model (and its $\\hat{Y}$)\n- Describe each\n\nBias bias and variance - glm vs knn\n\nBias and variance - k in knn?\n\nImpact of correlated features\n\n- in GLM\n- in KNN\n- PCA?  Drop correlated features?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## LM vs. KNN better with some predictors or overall?\n\n- \"Why do some features seem to improve performance more in linear models or only in KNNs?\"\n- \"What are some contexts where KNN doesn't work well? In other words, what are the advantages/disadvantages of using KNN?\"\n  - Always comes down to bias vs. variance\n  - Flexibility and N are key moderators of these two key factors.  \n  - k? - impact on bias, variance?\n- KNN for explanation?\n  - Visualizations (think of interaction plot above) make clear the effect\n  - Will learn more (better visualizations, variable importance, model comparisons) in later unit\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Categorical coding\n\n- Why do we do it? (Not need for every  algorithm!)\n- Describe the values assigned to the dummy coded features\n- Why these values? In other words, how can you interpret the effect of a dummy coded feature?\n- \"Dummy variable trap\"\n- How is it different from one-hot coding.  When to use or not use one-hot coding? \n- Other methods\n  - Ordinal coding\n  - Target (mean) encoding\n  - frequency coding\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Performance metrics\n\n- SSE, MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2\n- How else are SSE class of metrics used in glm?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Exploration \n\n- \"I feel that I can come up with models that decrease the RMSE, but I don't have good priors on whether adding any particular variable or observation will result in an improved model. I still feel a little weird just adding and dropping variables into a KNN and seeing what gets the validation RMSE the lowest (even though because we're using validation techniques it's a fine technique)\"\n  - Exploration is learning.  This is research.  If you knew the answer you wouldn't be doing the study\n  - Domain knowledge is still VERY important\n  - Some algorithms (LASSO, glmnet) will help with feature selection\n  - staying organized\n    - Script structure\n    - Good documentation - QMD as analysis notebook\n  - Some overfitting to validation will occur? Consequence?  Solutions?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## \"Curse of dimensionality\" - Bias vs. variance\n\n- Missing features produce biased models.\n- Unnecessary features or even many features relative to N produce variance\n- Does your available N in your algorithm support the features you need to have low bias. \n  - Mostly an empirical question - can't really tell otherwise outside of simulated data. Validation set is critical!\n  - Flexible models often need more N holding features constant\n  - Regularization (unit 6) will work well when lots of features \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-----\n\n## Sources of error\n\n- What are two broad sources of error?\n- What are two broad sources of reducible error.  Describe what they are and factors that affect them?\n- Why do we need independent validation data to select the best model configuration? \n- Why do we need test data if we used validation data to select among many model configurations\n- What is RMSE?  Connect it to metric you already know?  How is it being used in lm (two ways)?; in knn (one way)?\n- How does bias and variance manifest when you look at your performance metric (RMSE) in training and validation sets?\n- Will the addition of new features to a (lm?) model always reduce RMSE in train? in validation?  Connect to concepts of bias and variance\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## \"In GLM, why correlation/collinearity among predictors will cause larger variance? Is it because of overfitting?\"\n\n## KNN (black box) for explanatory purposes",
